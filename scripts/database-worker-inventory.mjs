Ordinary full pages were already worker-backed; raw cursor delta reads now share that worker. Process-held incognito database lifetime and the existing CLI-import history path remain explicit migration gaps. Incognito data cannot be reopened by a durable path in another isolate; this is remaining owner/lifetime work, not a new synchronous exception. A failed durable worker read never selects that local path.",

Process-held incognito reads and writes retain their sole native owner because their database cannot be reopened by path. The synchronous reaction kernel is shared by those admitted worker and incognito paths; no new broker capability or native fallback is added. Reaction mirroring reads durable source conversation bindings through the history worker, including a final read after account/config preparation and immediately before dispatch; synchronous handoff guards retain live reactor, session, and config checks. The conversation registry remains T1 because other synchronous callers are outside this cutover. Schemas, stored bytes, retention, and update behavior are unchanged.",

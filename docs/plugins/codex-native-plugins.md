title: "Native Codex plugins"
read_when:
  - You want Codex-mode OpenClaw agents to use native Codex plugins
  - You are migrating source-installed openai-curated Codex plugins
  - You are discovering or installing a Codex marketplace plugin
  - You are troubleshooting codexPlugins, app inventory, destructive actions, or plugin app diagnostics
---

Native Codex plugin support lets a Codex-mode OpenClaw agent use Codex
app-server's own app and plugin capabilities inside the same Codex thread that
handles the OpenClaw turn. Plugin calls stay in the native Codex transcript;
Codex app-server owns app-backed MCP execution. OpenClaw does not translate
Codex plugins into synthetic `codex_plugin_*` OpenClaw dynamic tools.

Use this page after the base [Codex harness](/plugins/codex-harness) is
working.

## Requirements

- The agent runtime must be the native Codex harness.
- `plugins.entries.codex.enabled` is `true`.
- `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.enabled` is `true`.
- Codex app-server reports `0.149.0` or newer. The official plugin ships
  `@openai/codex` `0.155.1`; newer custom, remote, and macOS desktop-owned
  binaries continue with a compatibility warning and normal runtime validation.
- The target Codex app-server can see the expected marketplace, plugin, and
  app inventory.
- Migration supports only `openai-curated` plugins that it observed as
  source-installed in the source Codex home. Codex serves the same catalog to
  API-key and Bedrock accounts under the `openai-api-curated` wire name;
  OpenClaw treats both names as the one curated catalog, so configured
  `openai-curated` plugins resolve from either.
- Native runtime support also includes other marketplaces already available to
  Codex, such as `openai-bundled`, `openai-primary-runtime`,
  `workspace-directory`, and marketplace manifests in the current repository.
  Plugins remain unavailable until an owner or `operator.admin` explicitly
  installs or enables their marketplace-qualified identity.

`codexPlugins` has no effect on OpenClaw-provider runs, ACP conversation
bindings, or other harnesses, because those paths never create Codex
app-server threads with native `apps` config.

OpenAI-side Codex account, app availability, and workspace app/plugin controls
come from the signed-in Codex account. See
[Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan)
for the OpenAI account and admin model.

## Quickstart

The source Codex home is the Codex CLI state directory you are migrating from:
`~/.codex` by default, or `CODEX_HOME` when that variable is set. See
[`openclaw migrate`](/cli/migrate) to point at a different one with `--from`.

Preview migration from the source Codex home:

```bash
openclaw migrate codex --dry-run
```

Add `--verify-plugin-apps` to make migration read the source installed app
snapshot and app metadata, requiring every owned app to be present, enabled,
and accessible before planning native activation:

```bash
openclaw migrate codex --dry-run --verify-plugin-apps
```

Apply the migration when the plan looks right:

```bash
openclaw migrate apply codex --yes
```

Migration writes explicit `codexPlugins` entries for eligible plugins and
calls Codex app-server `plugin/install` for selected plugins. A migrated
config looks like this:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          codexPlugins: {
            enabled: true,
            allow_destructive_actions: true,
            plugins: {
              "google-calendar": {
                enabled: true,
                marketplaceName: "openai-curated",
                pluginName: "google-calendar",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Migration remains limited to `openai-curated`. To find another plugin that
Codex can already see, list the available marketplace catalog and install the
exact marketplace-qualified identity:

```text
/codex plugins available
/codex plugins install security-review@company-tools
/codex plugins status security-review@company-tools
```

Codex discovers repository marketplaces from
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` in the current conversation workspace. An
owner does not need to add that marketplace to OpenClaw configuration before
listing or installing its plugins. Official bundled, primary-runtime, curated,
workspace, shared, and personal marketplaces depend on the signed-in Codex
account and upstream feature or administrator policies.
When Codex requires marketplace sources to be explicitly configured or
allowlisted, those requirements still apply; OpenClaw does not bypass them.

Installation writes an explicit configuration entry such as:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          codexPlugins: {
            enabled: true,
            plugins: {
              "security-review@company-tools": {
                enabled: true,
                marketplaceName: "company-tools",
                pluginName: "security-review",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The install command checks the authenticated owner or administrator before it
calls Codex `plugin/install`. Codex continues to enforce marketplace source,
workspace administrator, account, and connector-authentication policies.
Remote plugins that require a Codex installation interstitial, or do not
report whether one is required, must be installed in Codex first; rerun the
OpenClaw install command afterward to authorize the already-installed plugin.
OpenClaw keeps apps hidden when the response omits the exact marketplace,
plugin identity, detail identity, or app-readiness evidence. If a connector
requires additional sign-in, complete that authorization before expecting the
plugin's tools to become available.

Installing the plugin bundle and configuring OpenClaw app access do not confirm
hosted app connections. When installation returns apps that still need sign-in,
OpenClaw provides **Open &lt;app&gt; in ChatGPT** links to the app pages returned by
Codex. Sign in with the same ChatGPT account and workspace used by the Codex
harness. Opening a link does not verify the connection or make its tools callable
in the current conversation. If the browser shows a directory instead of the app,
or no safe link is available, run `/apps` in Codex CLI and select the app there.
Responses show up to five app links and explicitly report additional apps to
review in Codex CLI. These links are for hosted ChatGPT apps; native MCP server
setup remains separate.

An app can also request sign-in when you first use one of its tools. In the
Control UI, choose **Open link** to open the requested page in a separate tab.
The question stays pending while you sign in. After completing the browser step,
select **I've completed this step** and submit to let Codex refresh and retry.
Opening the link alone does not resume the tool or confirm a connection. Clients
without a link action still show the URL to open manually before answering.

For setup completed outside an active Codex sign-in prompt, refresh hosted app
inventory for the current Codex account/runtime:

```text
/codex plugins refresh
```

This refresh covers all hosted apps in that runtime; it is not a per-plugin
backend refresh. A plugin's **Refresh hosted apps** button runs this command.
The separate **Check status** button inspects only that plugin without refreshing
hosted tools. Neither action changes authorization or the current conversation's
app policy. Use `/new` or `/reset` after connecting, then inspect status in the new
conversation.

After a `codexPlugins` change, new Codex conversations pick up the updated
app set automatically. Run `/new` or `/reset` to refresh the current
conversation. A gateway restart is not required for plugin enable/disable
changes.

## Scheduled automations

When an authenticated owner creates an automation from a Codex turn, OpenClaw
captures the app IDs and approval limits callable on that exact Codex thread.
The stored authority is bound to the creator's prepared Codex profile and
account. Scheduled runs intersect that cap with current Codex policy and app
availability. They never gain new app IDs or a broader destructive,
open-world, or approval ceiling. Tools added later within an already captured
app may run only when both the stored ceiling and current policy allow them.

Scheduled app calls are unattended. Only actions explicitly allowed both when
the job was created and when it runs can proceed without a prompt. An action
that still requires approval or elicitation is declined. A changed account,
runtime, revoked app, narrower policy, or unavailable inventory stops before
app execution and reports how to restore access or reauthorize the automation.
Model fallbacks cannot move this authority to another runtime or account.

Jobs created before app authority capture may keep their ordinary OpenClaw
tool cap and continue non-app work, but cannot recover Codex app access
automatically. Recreate or reauthorize only a job that needs app access, from a
fresh authenticated owner turn. See
[Automations](/automation/cron-jobs#codex-apps-in-scheduled-automations).
Ordinary edits preserve captured app authority. Explicitly replacing a job's
`toolsAllow` cap without a fresh authenticated Codex authority capture clears
that authority; the next run reports that app access requires reauthorization.
An update from a fresh authenticated owner turn can instead capture and store a
new app ceiling for the updated job.

## Manage plugins from chat

`/codex plugins` inspects or changes configured native Codex plugins from the
same chat where you operate the Codex harness:

```text
/codex plugins
/codex plugins list
/codex plugins available
/codex plugins available security
/codex plugins available --page 2
/codex plugins install security-review@company-tools
/codex plugins status security-review@company-tools
/codex plugins refresh
/codex plugins disable google-calendar
/codex plugins enable google-calendar
/codex plugins disable security-review@company-tools
```

`/codex plugins` is an alias for `/codex plugins list`. The list shows each
configured plugin's key, on/off state, Codex plugin name, and marketplace
from `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.plugins`.

`available [query] [--page <n>]` requires an owner or `operator.admin`. It reads
Codex's marketplace catalogs using the bound workspace, including repository-local
plugins, without installing or enabling them. Search matches names, display titles, publishers, marketplaces,
and descriptions case-insensitively across the full returned catalog before
showing ten results per page. **Next page** and **Previous page** preserve your
search; channels without buttons show the commands to send. Search text is limited
to 100 characters. Use `--` before literal search text containing `--page`.

Results show display titles, publishers, and descriptions when supplied by Codex,
with explicit placeholders for missing publishers or descriptions. They retain
marketplace-qualified identities and availability restrictions; display titles
and publisher names do not change installation identity.
This searches Codex catalogs, not OpenClaw's plugin registry or every ChatGPT
connection. The owner-scoped `codex_plugins` model tool uses the same search
matching and is also read-only: it can recommend an exact install command but
cannot install, enable, or add a marketplace.

`status <name>@<marketplace> [page]` inspects exactly one configured plugin and
requires an owner or `operator.admin`. The qualified identity is required;
bare `status` or an unqualified name returns usage guidance pointing to `list`.

Status shows bundle installation, marketplace restrictions, Codex enablement, and
shared OpenClaw app access separately. Changes to OpenClaw app access take effect
on the next message; they do not install or enable the Codex bundle.

App results show at most five apps per page. A ChatGPT app-page link requires
confirmed hosted-app runtime support, an available plugin under its catalog
policy, and matching authorized metadata from `app/read`. A plugin's app
declaration or setup URL alone does not establish that access. OpenClaw app
access can be disabled while an eligible ChatGPT page remains available;
opening that page does not enable OpenClaw app access. Plugins without hosted
apps receive no ChatGPT connection or setup guidance. Status does not assess
their skills or native MCP server readiness.

The selected agent, auth profile, conversation workspace, and account email/plan
are shown when available. ChatGPT workspace identity remains unknown when
Codex does not report it; use the same account and workspace in the browser
when opening an eligible hosted app page.

Status uses `app/read` for app metadata and displays the `enabled` and `callable`
flags returned by `app/installed`. The runtime scope is the bound Codex thread
when available, or the account otherwise. These flags reflect effective Codex
configuration and the current runtime tool snapshot; they are separate from
OpenClaw app access. Status does not infer a separate connection state. Missing
app records and failed reads are reported explicitly instead of becoming false
flags.

`/codex plugins refresh` requires owner or `operator.admin` authority and confirmed
hosted-app support in the selected Codex account/runtime. It works without a
configured plugin. It invalidates that runtime's OpenClaw app cache, calls
Codex `app/installed` with `forceRefresh: true` and no `threadId`, and reads
metadata for the returned apps. It does not refresh marketplace catalogs,
reinstall plugin bundles, or reload native MCP servers.

After refreshing, use `/codex plugins status <name>@<marketplace>` to inspect
one plugin. Status never forces a hosted refresh. Disabled or blocked plugins
remain disabled or blocked, but do not prevent an otherwise permitted hosted
refresh.

A completed request does not prove that Codex replaced its snapshot or that a
live tool call will succeed. Refresh never installs, enables, authenticates,
or replaces a thread, and does not reload other conversations. After connecting,
use `/new` or `/reset` and inspect status again. Browser setup does not change
OpenClaw app access; local app-access changes take effect on the next message.
Unsupported methods, cancellation, and refresh failures provide a retry action
without treating the previous inventory as confirmed.

`install`, `enable`, and `disable` require the owner or a gateway client with
the `operator.admin` scope. OpenClaw's reserved `/codex` command is dispatched
before agent invocation, so a model-generated recommendation does not count as
installation approval. For a plugin that Codex has not installed yet, `install`
calls the Codex app-server and records the explicit plugin policy only after
installation succeeds. If Codex confirms that the plugin is already installed
and enabled, the same command records its authorization without installing it
again. `enable` and `disable` change OpenClaw's persisted policy; qualified
identities and existing configuration keys are both accepted.

Installing or enabling a configured plugin also turns on the global
`codexPlugins.enabled` switch without enabling `allow_all_plugins`. If a plugin
reports `auth_required`, authorize the app in Codex before starting a new
conversation. Authorization remains in effect for later conversations until
the plugin is disabled or the upstream account or workspace revokes access.

Only install plugins you trust. A Codex plugin can contribute skills, apps,
MCP servers, and hooks. Some hooks can participate in permission decisions,
so explicit installation trusts the selected plugin's code; it is not a
security review or an isolation boundary.

## How native plugin setup works

The integration tracks three states:

| State      | Meaning                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Installed  | Codex has the plugin bundle in the target app-server runtime.                                                                      |
| Enabled    | Codex reports the plugin enabled, and OpenClaw config allows it for Codex harness turns.                                           |
| Accessible | Codex app-server confirms the plugin's app entries are available for the active account and map to the configured plugin identity. |

For `openai-curated` plugins, migration is the durable install/eligibility
step:

- During planning, OpenClaw reads source Codex `plugin/read` details and
  checks the source Codex app-server account. `codex_subscription_required`
  means `account/read` positively identified an API-key or other
  non-ChatGPT account; a missing account is not evidence that a subscription
  is absent.
- By default, migration skips source app inventory calls: app-backed source
  plugins that pass the account gate are planned without source app
  accessibility verification. A missing account or failed `account/read`
  skips them with `codex_account_unavailable`.
- With `--verify-plugin-apps`, migration takes a fresh source `app/installed`
  snapshot, fetches authenticated metadata with `app/read`, and requires every
  owned app to be present, enabled, and accessible in the source Codex account
  before planning native activation. If `account/read` is missing or fails,
  strict verification can still prove access through the source app-server's
  configured bearer or header authentication. A positively identified
  non-ChatGPT account remains ineligible.

For explicitly approved plugins from any discovered marketplace, OpenClaw uses
its `plugin/installed` snapshot and `plugin/read` details to establish the
exact marketplace-qualified identity and app ownership. The installed-only
check during ordinary thread setup is read-only; apps from disabled or
unapproved plugins stay denied. Owner-issued installation is the explicit
mutation path. Missing or ambiguous ownership fails closed instead of granting
account-wide access.

Runtime app inventory is the target-session accessibility check for both
migrated curated plugins and manually configured workspace plugins. Before
enabled-policy turns, including warm reuse and cold resume, the Codex harness
rebuilds the restrictive thread app policy from current native settings while
reusing its app inventory and plugin metadata caches.

## Support boundary

- Only `openai-curated` plugins already installed in the source Codex
  app-server inventory are migration-eligible.
- Runtime supports explicitly approved plugins from Codex-discovered official,
  workspace, personal, shared, and repository-local marketplaces. A missing
  marketplace, plugin, ownership detail, or app readiness evidence exposes no
  plugin app.
- Positively identified non-ChatGPT source accounts fail the subscription gate.
  Missing or unreadable source accounts are unavailable by default.
  `--verify-plugin-apps` can instead establish access through authenticated
  source app inventory, including bearer- or header-authenticated app-servers.
  Inaccessible, disabled, or missing source apps and inventory refresh failures
  remain skipped manual items. Unreadable plugin details are skipped before the
  app-inventory gate.
- Migration writes explicit plugin identities (`marketplaceName` and
  `pluginName`); it does not write local `marketplacePath` cache paths.
- `codexPlugins.enabled` is the only global enablement switch; there is no
  `plugins["*"]` wildcard or config key that grants arbitrary install
  authority.
- Migration does not automatically import non-curated marketplaces, cached
  plugin bundles, hooks, or Codex config files. Use `/codex plugins available`
  and an owner-issued `/codex plugins install <plugin>@<marketplace>` command
  to opt into an additional discovered plugin.
- OpenClaw does not add new Git or local marketplace sources in this flow.
  Additional sources must already be configured in Codex or be discoverable
  from the bound repository.

## App inventory and ownership

OpenClaw first reads and caches one `plugin/installed` snapshot scoped to the
target Codex app-server and configured workspace. That snapshot covers plugins
from the marketplaces visible in that scope, including disabled plugin
identities; failed or incomplete snapshots are never cached. Conversations in
the same runtime and workspace share this metadata, and owner installation
invalidates it for all of them. App readiness remains specific to each thread.
`plugin/read` is
limited to exact configured plugin details required to establish ownership.
Explicit discovery queries `plugin/list` with the conversation workspace to
find repository marketplaces. Routine setup retains its existing curated
recovery behavior; additional marketplace installation requires the explicit
owner or administrator command.

Codex owns skill, hook, and MCP refresh after plugin installation. OpenClaw
refreshes its plugin and app inventories without reloading unrelated threads.
Use `/new` or `/reset` if an older custom Codex runtime does not make a newly
installed plugin available in an existing conversation.

OpenClaw reads installed app runtime state through `app/installed` and fetches
canonical app metadata with `app/read` in batches of at most 100 app IDs. The
first read force-refreshes a cold installed runtime snapshot. When multiple
configured curated plugins are installed, OpenClaw combines their cache
invalidations into a single app-inventory refresh. Ordinary cached reads do
not force a connector refresh for every new thread. OpenClaw caches the
combined inventory in memory for one hour and refreshes stale or missing
entries asynchronously. The cache is process-local; restarting the CLI or
gateway drops it.

Missing inventory methods, authentication errors, transport failures, and
connector refresh failures do not admit app tools. Ordinary turns, including
those using `allow_destructive_actions: "ask"`, can continue with native apps
disabled when inventory exceeds its startup budget. Scheduled runs stop if
their captured app policy cannot be revalidated within that budget.

Migration and runtime use separate cache keys:

- Source migration verification uses the source Codex home and start
  options. It runs only with `--verify-plugin-apps` and forces a fresh
  source runtime snapshot and metadata read for that planning run.
- Target runtime setup uses the target agent's Codex app-server identity when
  building and verifying the thread app config. Curated plugin activation
  invalidates that target cache key, then force-refreshes it after
  `plugin/install`. Explicit marketplace installation refreshes the same
  target runtime state before subsequent conversations use the plugin.

A plugin app is exposed only when OpenClaw can map it back to the configured
plugin through stable ownership: an exact app id from plugin detail, a known
MCP server name, or unique stable metadata. Display-name-only or ambiguous
ownership is excluded until the next inventory refresh proves ownership.

Missing plugins and marketplaces remain in saved settings for future discovery,
but are omitted from the effective runtime plugin policy. OpenClaw logs an error
and continues with healthy plugins and connected account apps. A missing entry's
permissions do not apply to other apps, even when their display names match.
The entry is reconsidered on the next normal inventory refresh; no saved settings
are removed. Found plugins disabled by an administrator retain their restrictions.

## Connected account apps

Owner-operated agents can opt into every app already connected to their Codex
account without requiring a matching plugin package:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          codexPlugins: {
            enabled: true,
            allow_all_plugins: true,
            allow_destructive_actions: "auto",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`allow_all_plugins: true` reads the installed app snapshot and authenticated
metadata when a new native Codex thread is established. It admits only
account-accessible apps. Codex must also confirm each admitted app is enabled
and callable for that thread. OpenClaw does not install, authenticate, or enable
apps globally. Existing threads keep their persisted app set; use `/new`,
`/reset`, or restart the gateway to pick up newly connected or revoked apps.

An explicitly disabled configured plugin found in the inventory overrides account-wide app
access. Because Codex `app/read` omits a disabled workspace plugin's display
names, OpenClaw uses its `plugin/installed` snapshot and reads only that exact
configured plugin's details to reserve its owned app IDs. This narrow,
read-only check does not discover unrelated marketplaces, activate the plugin,
or grant its apps. If the disabled plugin's ownership cannot be established,
the account-wide app selection fails closed.

Account apps inherit the global `codexPlugins.allow_destructive_actions` value,
which accepts `true`, `false`, `"auto"`, or `"ask"`. Explicit per-plugin policy
overrides the global policy for overlapping app ids. Inventory failures fail
closed instead of falling back to an unrestricted default.

## Thread app config

OpenClaw injects a restrictive `config.apps` patch for the Codex thread:
`_default` is disabled, and only apps owned by enabled configured plugins or
accessible account apps admitted by `allow_all_plugins` are enabled.

An app can be installed and authenticated but non-callable in the account-wide
snapshot while `_default` is disabled. OpenClaw provisionally admits only
ownership-proven, policy-allowed apps, creates the restrictive thread, and then
rereads `app/installed` once with the resulting thread ID and
`forceRefresh: false`. If the snapshot reports an app missing, disabled, or
non-callable, OpenClaw logs one warning listing the unavailable apps and
continues with the remaining tools. Codex still enforces the thread's effective
app, managed, workspace, and tool policies. An unavailable optional app does
not block unrelated chat or heartbeat runs.

If the snapshot request itself fails, the provisional thread is never bound
or used. OpenClaw deletes a failed persistent provisional thread, unsubscribes
a failed ephemeral thread, and retires the app-server connection if safe
cleanup cannot be confirmed.

`destructive_enabled` on each app comes from the effective global or
per-plugin `allow_destructive_actions` policy; `true`, `"auto"`, and `"ask"`
all set `destructive_enabled: true`, and `false` sets it `false`. Codex still
enforces destructive tool metadata from its native app tool annotations.
`_default` is disabled with `open_world_enabled: false`; enabled plugin apps
get `open_world_enabled: true`. OpenClaw does not expose a separate
plugin-level open-world policy knob and does not maintain per-plugin
destructive tool-name deny lists.

Tool approval mode defaults to automatic for admitted apps, so non-destructive
read tools run without a same-thread approval prompt. Destructive tools stay
controlled by each app's `destructive_enabled` policy.

## Destructive action policy

Destructive plugin elicitations are allowed by default for configured Codex
plugins, while unsafe schemas and ambiguous ownership fail closed:

- Global `allow_destructive_actions` defaults to `true`.
- Per-plugin `allow_destructive_actions` overrides the global policy for
  that plugin.
- `false`: OpenClaw excludes destructive hosted app tools before execution.
  Native approval requests for permitted tools still go through OpenClaw consent,
  including during a `/btw` side question. Plugin-provided MCP server approval
  requests receive a deterministic decline.
- `true`: OpenClaw auto-accepts only safe schemas it can map to an approval
  response, such as a boolean approve field.
- `"auto"`: OpenClaw exposes destructive plugin actions to Codex, then
  turns ownership-proven MCP approval elicitations into OpenClaw plugin
  approvals before returning the Codex approval response.
- `"ask"`: OpenClaw uses the same Codex write/destructive gating as
  `"auto"`, overrides saved per-tool and per-account approvals in the native
  thread's configuration, and offers only one-shot approval or denial. Saved
  native settings stay unchanged, and user-config reloads preserve the thread's
  approval policy. These checks also run before reusing a thread or answering a
  `/btw` side question. Changed override keys rebuild the thread with current policy.
  For each admitted app using `"ask"`, OpenClaw selects Codex's human approvals
  reviewer for that app so Codex sends its approval elicitations to
  OpenClaw; other apps and non-app thread approvals keep their configured
  reviewer and policy.
- Missing plugin identity, ambiguous ownership, a missing or mismatched
  turn id, or an unsafe elicitation schema declines instead of prompting.

Apps outside the admitted policy stay disabled even if native Codex settings
enable them. Native settings must be verified before an enabled policy can admit
app tools. When no app can be admitted, Codex's app tool surface is disabled
without reading native app settings. Disabling plugin apps also skips app
inventory discovery. Active legacy managed app settings outrank native thread
configuration and prevent app admission; move those app settings to a supported
user or project configuration layer. Native administrative requirements remain
authoritative.

| `codex_subscription_required`                     | The source app-server positively identified an API-key or other non-ChatGPT account.                                                 | Log in to the Codex app with subscription auth, then rerun migration.                                                  |
| `codex_account_unavailable`                       | The source account was missing or `account/read` failed without strict app verification.                                             | Restore source account access, or use `--verify-plugin-apps` when authenticated source app inventory can prove access. |
| `marketplace_missing`, `plugin_missing`           | The exact marketplace or configured plugin is unavailable in the installed snapshot; plugin apps fail closed.                        | Verify the target app-server's `plugin/installed` response and exact configured plugin identity.                       |
| `plugin_detail_unavailable`                       | OpenClaw could not read the exact configured plugin's ownership details.                                                             | Inspect the target app-server's `plugin/installed` and `plugin/read` responses.                                        |
| `plugin_disabled`                                 | Codex reports the plugin installed but disabled.                                                                                     | Enable the plugin in Codex, or have the owner explicitly install and authorize it again.                               |
| `plugin_activation_failed`                        | Plugin activation did not complete.                                                                                                  | Use the attached diagnostic to distinguish marketplace, auth, refresh, or workspace-readiness failures.                |
| `app_inventory_missing`, `app_inventory_stale`    | App readiness came from an empty or stale cache.                                                                                     | OpenClaw schedules an async refresh automatically; plugin apps stay excluded until ownership and readiness are known.  |
| `app_ownership_ambiguous`                         | App inventory only matched by display name.                                                                                          | The app stays hidden from the Codex thread until a later refresh proves ownership.                                     |

**Workspace plugin is installed but not visible:** confirm the workspace
`plugin/installed` snapshot reports the exact configured ID as installed and
enabled, then confirm `app/installed` returns every owned app for the same
Codex account and `app/read` returns its metadata. An app disabled only by the
account-wide default can become callable after OpenClaw starts and verifies
its explicitly configured thread. Revoked auth, missing metadata, disabled
workspace plugins, and Codex managed or workspace restrictions still block
access. Reauthorize or repair those upstream conditions before starting a new
thread. If you changed that state after the gateway cached app inventory, run
`/codex plugins refresh`, then use `/new` or `/reset`.
OpenClaw does not authenticate plugin apps on the owner's behalf.

For `plugin_detail_unavailable`, verify that the exact installed marketplace
and plugin identity select a matching `plugin/read` result. OpenClaw keeps
owned apps hidden when that selector or ownership detail is unavailable. For
`plugin_activation_failed`, inspect the marketplace, app authorization, and
post-install refresh diagnostics. An explicitly approved plugin must be
installed, enabled, and authenticated before its apps can appear in a thread.

**Config changed but the agent cannot see the plugin:** run `/codex plugins
list` to confirm the configured state, then `/new` or `/reset`. Existing
Codex thread bindings keep the app config they started with until OpenClaw
establishes a new harness session or replaces a stale binding.

**Destructive action is declined:** check the global and per-plugin
`allow_destructive_actions` values. Even with `true`, `"auto"`, or `"ask"`,
unsafe elicitation schemas and ambiguous plugin identity still fail closed.

Checks 0-2 cover config normalization and the legacy config key migrations,
plus how doctor publishes shared-state schema during an update.

## Channel ownership during an update

When Doctor migrates a legacy `agents.list` roster without a `default: true` marker
to explicit ownership, it also preserves unbound accounts with a binding to the first
agent from the old list, which received their implicit traffic before the
update. Existing account bindings and narrower conversation routes remain unchanged. Doctor
reports each added binding and saves it with the roster migration through the
normal config backup and validation flow.

Update-channel migration and manual `openclaw doctor --fix` use the original
roster from the config snapshot. A narrower conversation route never establishes
account-wide ownership. If the original roster is unavailable, Doctor reports
`unresolved: original roster unavailable` with the exact binding to add and leaves
the account's bindings unchanged. An unresolved account stays blocked
with that reason while the Gateway and other accounts continue running; it does
not enter a restart loop. Add the reported binding and restart the Gateway.

## ACP agents' model precedence

For an agent with `runtime.type: "acp"`, `agents.entries.*.model` (string form) or
`agents.entries.*.model.primary` (object form) selects the ACP harness model. This
also applies to harness selections that look like `provider/model` references.
OpenClaw resolves a separate native default, using `agents.defaults.model` when
configured. Explicit native session, utility, and subagent model selections retain
their precedence.

Doctor reports this separation as information (`core/doctor/acp-agent-model`),
naming the configured path, harness model, and resolved native default. Matching
and differing selections are both supported configurations. This notice proposes
no repair and does not rewrite the config; ACP turns keep their configured harness
selection.

## Missing plugins during migration

A configured plugin that is missing or cannot finish installation does not block
Doctor, updates, or Gateway startup. OpenClaw records a warning that names the
plugin, its pending migration, and the command to finish installation or repair.
The Gateway continues serving the available plugins.

`doctor --fix` repairs an older shared database schema before recording pending
plugin migrations. Missing plugins therefore do not prevent the database repair;
their inputs stay available for a later retry.

Deferred migrations keep their state and legacy config inputs in place. Config
repairs can still update unrelated settings, while the pending plugin's retired
fields remain inactive. After installing or repairing the plugin, run
`openclaw doctor --fix` to complete its migration and clear the pending warning.
During an update driven by an older version, plugin installation can remain
deferred until that updater finishes; its pending inputs receive the same
protection.
Session edits and deletions made after the core import remain authoritative when
the plugin migration resumes.

While a migration is pending, explicit config edits that would change or remove
its retained inputs are refused with the recovery command. Unrelated settings
remain writable. Complete the plugin migration before editing those inputs.

## Schema publication during a 2026.9.2 update

When OpenClaw 2026.9.2 drives an update that needs a newer shared-state schema,
Doctor applies the migration content and reports
`schema content applied; version publication deferred until update run <id> finishes`.
The old updater can finish its ledger access, while the new Gateway uses the
migrated content. Publication waits until all affected terminal runs are at least
five minutes old; a running row unchanged for more than 30 minutes counts as
abandoned. Every writable database open follows this rule, and the Gateway
watcher schedules publication after the deadline.

Ordinary CLI commands, including Doctor, remain usable while that Gateway runs.
Applied content counts as ready; only the owning Gateway, or a writable opener
when no Gateway owns the state directory, publishes the version after the grace.

Agent-database migrations are not version-deferred. During the published 2026.9.2
updater's rollback window, Doctor validates private state copies and leaves the
live databases and config unchanged. After package rollback is no longer possible,
the fresh update continuation requires a verified backup covering each pending
agent database and current update ownership before Doctor migrates the live state.
Managed updates retain the shipped helper's original handoff record unchanged.

Doctor reports `update-schema-bump-unfenced` when this handoff cannot be verified,
backup coverage is missing, the required shared-state metadata table is absent,
or a migration fails. Follow the
[manual update sequence](/install/updating#updating-from-2026.9.2-across-a-schema-bump)
from the refusal. See [Database schemas](/reference/database-schemas#schema-bumps-and-older-updaters)
for the publication contract and the remaining risk for an old CLI stalled
beyond the grace period.

## Replay a July 2026 config upgrade

From a source checkout with its pnpm dependencies installed, run:

```bash
node scripts/doctor-config-upgrade-replay.mjs
```

The driver runs with plain Node and imports only Node built-ins. It requires
the checkout's fixture and `pnpm openclaw` build wrapper; an installed npm
package alone cannot run this replay. No `tsx` invocation is needed for the driver.

The replay uses the synthetic `test/fixtures/doctor-2026.7.1.json` config. It
builds through `pnpm openclaw`, isolates the home, state, config, and logs under
`.local`, and selects free loopback ports. It captures validation before repair,
two `doctor --fix --non-interactive` passes, validation after the first pass,
and Gateway startup. It keeps the original config, both repaired copies, and
command output in the printed directory. The second pass must leave the config
bytes unchanged. It never needs credentials or a running Gateway.

A second fixture covers `messages.tts` moving to `tts` before retired TTS fields
are removed. Doctor preserves the old preference-file path in shared machine
state before removing `prefsPath`; existing canonical settings and stored state
keep precedence, and the preferences file stays intact.

The fixture combines a two-agent `agents.list` roster, the legacy model
allowlist, local memory search, a CLI audio model, Telegram account allowlists,
and the retired `meta.lastTouchedAt`, `gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit`, and
`gateway.nodes.denyCommands` keys. The current media field is optional plural
`capabilities`; Doctor adds `["audio"]` when moving an audio-only model to
`tools.media.models`. A singular `capability` field is not required.

Local embeddings keep the `local` provider and their existing model selection.
The in-process `node-llama-cpp` runtime was replaced by a managed `llama-server`.
When managed setup is missing, Doctor and Gateway startup name the degraded
semantic recall and the plugin's guided setup command:

```bash
openclaw models --agent main auth login --provider llama-cpp --method local
```

Run that command interactively and choose the appropriate managed setup, then
verify with `openclaw memory status --deep`. Setup can offer embeddings without
changing the chat model. Downloads require setup consent. In the July provider,
`memorySearch.model` did not select the local GGUF: `local.modelPath` did.
Doctor therefore preserves both fields instead of silently turning an ignored
model value into a different embedding model. See [llama.cpp](/plugins/llama-cpp).

## Checks 0-2

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="0. Optional update (git installs)">
    If this is a git checkout and Doctor is running interactively, it offers to update before running its checks. Accepting uses the normal `openclaw update` lifecycle for that checkout, including validation, recovery, and Gateway restart. The source update keeps your saved update channel unchanged. Externally managed installs continue Doctor without offering self-update; update them through their deployment owner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="1. Config normalization">
    GitHub Copilot now requires explicit provider config, a saved Copilot auth profile, or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. Generic `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` no longer activate it. Doctor reports this change once when only a generic GitHub token is present. The retired `plugins.entries.github-copilot.config.discovery.enabled` setting is ignored during config loading, including malformed values, and removed when Doctor saves the config.

    Doctor normalizes legacy value shapes into the current schema. Current Talk speech config is `talk.provider` + `talk.providers.<provider>`, with realtime voice config under `talk.realtime.*`. Doctor rewrites old `talk.voiceId` / `talk.voiceAliases` / `talk.modelId` / `talk.outputFormat` / `talk.apiKey` shapes into the provider map, and rewrites legacy top-level realtime selectors (`talk.mode`, `talk.transport`, `talk.brain`, `talk.model`, `talk.voice`) into `talk.realtime`.

    Doctor also warns when `plugins.allow` is non-empty and tool policy uses wildcard or plugin-owned tool entries. `tools.allow: ["*"]` only matches tools from plugins that actually load; it does not bypass the exclusive plugin allowlist.

    A tool policy scope with nonempty `allow` and `alsoAllow` lists fails validation. `doctor --fix` merges the lists only when the effective profile grants remain unchanged for every agent and provider that inherits the extras. It retains `alsoAllow: []` as an explicit override so inherited extras cannot reappear. If the extras may extend a profile or grant Gateway configuration-read access, Doctor leaves the conflicting scope untouched and reports the exact keys and values to review manually. This applies at the root `tools` policy, per-agent and per-provider policies, and channel or gateway tool policies. Sandbox lists remain untouched because `allow` and `alsoAllow` inherit independently; conflicting sandbox lists still require manual repair. Plugin-owned `plugins.entries.*.config` is left to the owning plugin's doctor contract. Gateway startup uses the same permission-preserving repair; unresolved conflicts still require operator guidance before the config can validate.

    `doctor --fix` removes `workspace: null` from `agents.entries.<id>` so normal workspace resolution can apply. It also removes invalid `heartbeat.activeHours` windows from agent entries and `agents.defaults`, preserving other heartbeat settings. Reconfigure a valid window if needed; without an explicit or inherited window, heartbeat hours are unrestricted. These repairs also apply after migrating a legacy `agents.list` roster.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Legacy config key migrations">
    Ordinary Doctor, including `doctor --non-interactive`, automatically normalizes a legacy single-file config when the shared migration transforms produce a fully valid result. This also covers older npm updaters that invoke Doctor without `--fix`. The planner still requires complete plugin validation. Doctor preserves the original in the config backup ring and keeps state migration ordering intact. Includes, externally managed config, newer-written config, and remaining validation errors require the existing explicit repair or operator recovery path. Updaters that explicitly defer plugin repair or advertise a later writable config handoff keep automatic normalization deferred. This does not enable repair maintenance, service changes, or exec-approval migration without `--fix`.

    Older Git updaters can keep an in-memory config snapshot and write it after Doctor exits. When that parent marks the update in progress without advertising support for Doctor config writes, Doctor preserves the config and defers importing retired plugin install records, including with `--fix`. The first fresh Gateway startup then performs the complete migration. Existing canonical plugin install records keep precedence; missing records from the legacy config are imported before that config is rewritten. Startup also handles records restored after the same build previously completed its migration checkpoint.

    Gateway startup automatically applies deterministic, prompt-free legacy config migrations when an otherwise invalid single-file config can be fully migrated. It uses the same migration transforms as `openclaw doctor --fix`, validates the complete result including plugin config before writing, and reports the applied changes. The write runs under the startup migration lease and preserves the previous config in the five-slot `openclaw.json.bak` / `.bak.1` through `.bak.4` backup ring.

    Startup checks the authored config revision, included files, and environment-resolved values before migration writes. Runtime path expansion (such as `~/.openclaw/wiki` on Windows) does not count as an input change. A real change reports whether the config path, file contents, included files, or resolved values changed; restart so migrations can validate the new inputs.

    Startup does not migrate configs using `$include`, configs in Nix mode, or configs last written by a newer OpenClaw version. It also skips automatic config migration while an update is in progress and plugin validation is deferred; the post-update doctor run owns that repair. If any validation or legacy-key issue remains after migration, startup leaves the config unchanged, refuses to start, and prints the `openclaw doctor --fix` hint. An interactive terminal can still offer to run doctor and retry once for configs that need other repairs; headless services stop with the hint.

    When model migrations change a configured consumer between subscription/OAuth and metered API-key billing, Doctor reports the consumer, model, and old and new routes after saving the config. The warning also appears in the diagnostic log and update run record. A later Doctor run does not repeat it when the resolved billing route is unchanged. Missing credentials are not treated as proof of a billing change.

    During an update, Doctor records model-retirement repairs that must wait until plugin installation finishes. The updated OpenClaw completes those repairs after plugin convergence, even when no plugin version changed. `openclaw update status` records their completion so retired subscription models do not fall through to metered API credentials.

    Utility-model separation preserves an older config's implicit primary before recording `meta.migrations.utilityModelSeparation: true`. Doctor and normal config writes use the previous config to save that primary explicitly; existing primary selections, fallbacks, and credential bindings stay authoritative. This keeps regular chat available when the old implicit primary also served utility tasks. Fresh utility setup records the separation without choosing a primary, and a provider added during utility setup is not mistaken for the previous primary. See [agent model configuration](/gateway/config-agents/models#agentsdefaultsmodel).

    Other commands that encounter legacy keys still ask you to run `openclaw doctor`. Doctor explains the issues, shows its migrations, and rewrites `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with the updated schema. Cron job store migrations are also handled by `openclaw doctor --fix`; automatic config-key migration does not import legacy session stores or repair services.

    When a readable active config can be fully migrated, Doctor preserves it before considering last-known-good recovery. This includes legacy multi-agent rosters with a `default: true` owner: unrelated settings and the original agent ownership survive the migration.

    Per-agent migrations apply to both keyed `agents.entries` and legacy `agents.list` rosters, including rosters that already set `agents.ownership: "explicit"`. For example, Doctor preserves an agent's legacy `memorySearch` settings under `memory.search` and converts `sandbox.perSession` to `sandbox.scope`. Existing values at the current config paths take precedence.

    For legacy rosters with multiple agents and no resolvable ambient owner, Doctor seeds `agents.defaults.systemAgent.agentId` from a uniquely marked `default: true` agent, or `main` when present. Sole-agent rosters and legacy default markers already honored by the runtime need no owner repair and produce no missing-owner advice. Explicit fleet ownership disables the legacy default-marker fallback, so those rosters may still need repair. Doctor also pins `agents.defaults.heartbeat.agentId` only when heartbeat enrollment would otherwise be unresolved; existing heartbeat owners, shared defaults, and per-agent enrollment are preserved. These changes are reported and saved by `doctor --fix`, including the update-time doctor pass. If no default can be identified, configure the system-agent owner explicitly.

    <Note>
      Doctor only carries automatic migrations for roughly two months after a
      key is retired. Older legacy keys (for example the original
      `routing.queue`, `routing.bindings`, `routing.agents`/`defaultAgentId`,
      `routing.transcribeAudio`, top-level `agent.*`, or top-level `identity`
      from the pre-multi-agent config shape) no longer have a migration path;
      config using them now fails validation instead of being rewritten. Fix
      those keys by hand against the current
      [configuration reference](/gateway/configuration-reference) before doctor
      can proceed.

    Code Mode's runtime migration preserves an explicit QuickJS choice in global config, keyed agent entries, and legacy agent rosters. Existing `executor` values win, and activation and limits remain unchanged. Selecting the bundled QuickJS runtime works even when generic plugins are disabled or allowlisted, without enabling other plugins; an explicit deny or disabled entry for `code-mode-quickjs` still blocks it. Configurations that never selected a runtime use the new `node` default. See [Code Mode executors](/tools/code-mode/executors) before enabling Node execution; `node:vm` is not a security boundary.

    Doctor names the retired tuning paths it actually removes in one notice, including explicit `false` values: `Removed retired runtime tuning knobs: diagnostics.memoryPressureSnapshot; built-in defaults now apply.` Startup repair uses the same migration. Memory-pressure events remain available; use [diagnostics export or manual allocation profiling](/gateway/diagnostics) for current evidence.

    <Note>
      The Voice Call plugin supplies the migration for its legacy config keys.
      `openclaw doctor --fix` invokes it and persists the canonical shape in
      `openclaw.json`; runtime config parsing accepts only current keys.
      Existing canonical settings win over legacy values, including streaming
      provider credentials, models, and timing. Doctor reports retained
      destinations instead of claiming those legacy values were moved.
    </Note>

    Per-agent `memorySearch` migrations work with both old `agents.list` rosters and keyed `agents.entries`. Doctor preserves explicit `memory.search` settings when merging legacy values, including environment references moved to the new paths. When repairs affect only per-agent settings, single-file agent includes stay in their included file.

    When model-policy migration accompanies an agent repair in the same included file, Doctor keeps the explicit policy and repaired settings in that file. A policy-only repair can target a deeper defaults include without rewriting its parent files. Existing include ownership, backup, and conflict checks still apply.

    The retired `tools.message.allowCrossContextSend` flag migrates at both root and per-agent scopes. Doctor preserves the effective cross-context permissions, including an agent's `false` override of a root `true` flag.

    Account-default guidance for multi-account channels:

    - If two or more `channels.<channel>.accounts` entries are configured without `channels.<channel>.defaultAccount` or `accounts.default`, doctor warns that fallback routing can pick an unexpected account.
    - If `channels.<channel>.defaultAccount` is set to an unknown account ID, doctor warns and lists configured account IDs.

    In multi-agent configs, `doctor --fix` preserves the historical account owner
    from the original legacy roster. Existing routes remain unchanged. Accounts
    without historical ownership evidence need an explicit binding; Doctor never
    promotes a narrower conversation route to account-wide ownership.

A cloud session is an ordinary session whose coding work runs on another machine. It appears in the sidebar, streams into chat, and keeps its transcript exactly like a local session — the Gateway stays the owner of the conversation, the reconciled workspace, model credentials, and placement records, while commands, file edits, and tool work execute remotely. The session and its durable state survive a remote failure. Reclaimed or suspended cloud workers restart on the next message, including idle workers released after a Gateway build update; failed placements require cleanup and explicit redispatch. An offline paired device keeps its placement and waits for the device to return.

Sessions can run in three places, and every one of them uses the same session, the same chat, and the same Place picker:

| Destination       | The machine                                                                       | Best for                                                    | Scope to dispatch |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Gateway (default) | The host running `openclaw gateway`                                               | Everyday sessions                                           | —                 |
| Paired device     | Your own hardware, connected once with `openclaw connect`                         | Spare Macs, build boxes, servers you already own            | `operator.write`  |
| Cloud worker      | A throwaway machine leased through [Crabbox](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox) | Burst capacity, long jobs, isolation from your own machines | `operator.admin`  |

In all remote placements, model inference stays proxied through the Gateway — provider credentials never reach the remote machine — and completed work is retained with the Gateway as accepted repository checkpoints or changes in a Gateway-source managed worktree. Both the OpenClaw runtime (`worker-turn`) and Codex (`remote-exec`) can use the same destinations.

A **session** is the conversation clients attach to. A **device** is paired hardware (`node` in the protocol); **runner** is an internal term for an execution host. Placement chooses where work runs, while isolation describes the boundary on that host, not another destination.

## Start without a Gateway checkout

In **New Session**, select a GitHub repository in **Place**, choose a paired device or cloud profile, and optionally set the source ref under **Remote checkout**. Cloud profiles can also offer operating-system and machine-class choices in Place; the machine list follows the selected operating system. The Gateway records the source; the node fetches it and creates the session branch. No project clone or worktree is created on the Gateway. Startup waits for active placement before sending your prompt, and retry/reload recovery preserves the repository and ref.

Both OpenClaw and Codex use the managed node connection for repository preparation. A provider with only an SSH carrier cannot host this source. Selecting an existing Gateway folder instead keeps the [managed-worktree flow](/concepts/managed-worktrees), including local changes and unpublished commits.

The first preparation pins the resolved upstream commit. Accepted changes survive Stop and replacement as immutable checkpoints; restoration still depends on the pinned upstream commit remaining available. An explicit **Move session… → Gateway** fetches that source and materializes a managed worktree. See [dispatch and recovery](/gateway/cloud-workers#dispatching-a-session) for the RPC sequence and setup permissions.

## Images and attachments

Attach images and PDFs through the normal chat composer, including on later turns in an existing cloud session. The Gateway prepares native image input, including rendered pages from scanned PDFs. Codex receives image input through its Gateway-side app-server. Its `remote-exec` placement stages managed originals for remote file tools before execution; those temporary copies are excluded from workspace reconciliation. The retained-input rules below apply to OpenClaw `worker-turn` sessions.

OpenClaw `worker-turn` sessions accept images, including image-only messages and ordered mixtures of inline and offloaded images. For models with vision support, the Gateway hydrates current input and recent replay from its managed media using the same image sanitization, ordering, and history pruning as local sessions. Text-only models receive attachment file paths without native image input. The Gateway keeps the canonical transcript and original attachment references; only the worker's input receives remote file paths.

Attachments sent after dispatch are copied into the worker workspace through the authenticated transfer channel. This requires a current node-host installation as well as the worker bundle; update paired devices or the cloud profile's node package before using it. File tools can read their source files, including non-image attachments. Copies do not replace the active workspace or overwrite earlier worker edits to the same attachment. Placement and turn ownership are checked before transfer and launch; an unavailable or oversized current attachment produces an error instead of silently dropping the image. Unavailable historical sources, including originals expired by configured attachment retention, are omitted from replay staging with a warning so they do not block a new turn. Canonical transcript references and existing private copies remain unchanged.

Raw inputs use an OpenClaw-owned directory under `media/inbound/openclaw-staged-<id>/`, with a local Git exclusion. Local and writable sandbox sessions use the same rule. Automatic input retention requires a producer-generated directory name and its intact regular `.gitignore` ownership marker; similarly named ignored project directories are not selected merely by their name. Input copies and edits remain available through workspace reconciliation, worker replacement, and managed-worktree removal and restore, but ordinary Git publication does not include them. To publish an image or document as part of the project, explicitly copy it to an ordinary project path first. Existing tracked files stay project-owned; this does not remove files from earlier commits or undo prior publication.

Turn cancellation, admitted-run closure, or loss of the exact placement claim cancels attachment streaming and the node transfer invocation, and prevents the abandoned turn from launching. Once cancellation is observed, no subsequent attachment is installed. There is a bounded final-write limitation with `fs-safe` 0.7.0: an exclusive `create()` that has already been entered may finish and leave its private copy. The transfer still rejects after that operation returns. Previously completed copies and worker edits remain intact; cancellation does not unlink files by path. TODO(fs-safe): adopt guarded exclusive-create with identity-bound rollback once the dependency supports it, closing this remaining window.

Attachment staging uses the existing workspace-result transfer limits (25,000 files and 256 MiB total), with a 6 MiB per-file media read limit. Encoded launch, inference, and image-bearing transcript frames must also fit within 25 MiB; base64 encoding counts toward those frame limits. Non-image transcript content and unrelated control traffic retain their 64 KiB limits. Worker turns have no native steering transport: messages received during a turn use the existing queued follow-up path, retaining their images and media metadata.

## Paired devices: your own hardware as session hosts

Pair any machine with one pasted command, then opt it into session hosting:

```bash
openclaw connect <join-url> --service --session-host
```

The device holds an outbound connection to the Gateway, advertises worker slots (one per CPU core by default, tunable with `nodeHost.workerRuns.capacity`), and can optionally run each hosted session in a Docker-compatible container (`nodeHost.workerRuns.isolation: "container"`). A device that goes offline keeps its active placement — the session waits for it to reconnect rather than losing work.

The node host reconnects after transient transport loss. A worker child has a bounded 120-second admission window. If that window expires **before the turn starts**, the Gateway can launch another child, up to five attempts total (about ten minutes plus backoff), within the original turn timeout. Launch retries use exponential backoff with jitter; each attempt keeps its own terminal result and reason in the node launch journal. Credential and build rejections are terminal, and work that already started is never replayed by this policy.

If a journal-terminal worker has released its turn claim but teardown stalls, stuck-session recovery records the turn failure after a 30-second cleanup grace, on the next diagnostic cycle. Live workers and turns that still hold their claims are unaffected. On Gateway restart, orphan workspace cleanup for failed placements runs in the background after readiness; ownership fencing and pending workspace-result recovery still run before readiness.

See [Nodes](/nodes) for pairing, capacity, isolation, and offline behavior, and [Connect](/cli/connect) for the CLI.

## Cloud workers: rented machines through Crabbox

Configure a profile under `cloudWorkers.profiles` and the bundled Crabbox plugin provisions machines on demand across cloud backends (AWS, Hetzner, and others), runs your setup command, enrolls the box as a temporary node, and tears everything down when the session stops. The machine is disposable by design: no standing credentials live on it, and the durable state stays with the Gateway.

See [Cloud Workers](/gateway/cloud-workers) for profiles, requirements, dispatching, moving sessions between destinations, and the security model.

## Viewing the session desktop

Open **Desktop** from a session to connect directly to its execution machine. Cloud sessions select their worker desktop; sessions on paired devices select that device. The chat panel shows connection progress or a retry action instead of offering unrelated machines. The pop-out window keeps the session in its link, so both viewers follow placement changes and disconnect from the previous machine when the session moves or stops. A stopped cloud session does not switch either viewer to the Gateway desktop.

If you choose a source in the Desktop picker, the panel keeps that choice when the session's placement changes. **Open desktop in new window** opens that source and requests the panel's current view-only or control mode. Desktop links contain no credentials and do not grant control; the new viewer still performs its normal authentication and permission checks.

The machine must already support desktop viewing. For cloud workers, enable the [Cloud Worker Desktop lab and desktop profile setting](/gateway/cloud-workers#desktop-interactive). Opening Desktop starts in view-only mode and does not change the machine's permissions or the agent's tool policy. The command palette's Desktop action also follows the current session on chat pages. Outside chat, it opens the machine picker.

To enter text from your local clipboard, take control and choose **Keyboard** before pasting with **Command+V** on macOS or **Ctrl+V** on Windows and Linux. The Keyboard field sends the pasted text to the remote desktop; shortcuts directed at the desktop canvas still operate on the remote machine. Keyboard input stays disabled until the control connection is ready.

## Desktop and computer control

A desktop-enabled cloud session uses the same machine for the chat Desktop panel and the agent's `computer` tool. Enable the **Cloud Worker Desktop** lab and provision a Crabbox profile with `settings.desktop: true`. OpenClaw starts the worker's CUA provider inside the provisioned desktop session; the agent does not need to discover or choose a paired computer. Both OpenClaw and Codex sessions use this binding. A paired-device session instead uses that device's enabled Computer Control provider.

OpenClaw worker turns preserve their node host's display and desktop-session environment for local `exec` commands. On a desktop-enabled Linux worker, launch a GUI application with `background: true` to keep using `computer` while it runs.

Use a vision-capable model and a tool profile that permits `computer`. For the `coding` profile, add `computer` to `tools.alsoAllow`. The bound desktop is available under default remote-session sandbox policy; explicit sandbox allowlists and denies still apply. Observe the Desktop panel while the agent works, and pause the agent before taking manual control to avoid competing input.

Worker transcripts retain screenshots. Codex exposes the computer tool directly, outside code mode, so screenshot results reach the model as images. To keep later model requests within the transport limit, OpenClaw can replace older, already processed images with a text marker in the model context while preserving the current computer frame and unprocessed images. Opaque provider replay remains unchanged; if its required context cannot fit, the turn fails with recovery guidance.

Computer control stays bound to the admitted turn, placement, node connection, and provider. If an OpenClaw worker disconnects, its computer execution closes even between tool calls; start a new turn to regain computer control after reconnecting. Other durable session operations can still finish. Stopping or replacing the machine invalidates old tool handles; an unavailable desktop never selects another connected computer. Disposable cloud desktops remain absent from the ordinary paired-computer picker. See [Computer use](/nodes/computer-use) for supported actions and [Cloud Worker Desktop](/gateway/cloud-workers#desktop-interactive) for setup and viewing permissions.

For `remote-exec` turns, computer cleanup finishes before workspace reconciliation. If cleanup fails, OpenClaw keeps the captured reply, usage, delivery evidence, and any earlier error or interruption, adds a bounded cleanup diagnostic, and does not automatically replay the turn. A workspace recovery failure reports both problems. Security-sensitive resource cleanup still rejects completion rather than becoming an advisory warning; resolve the reported cleanup problem before retrying.

## Automatic load balancing across devices

You do not have to pick a device. Choosing **Auto** (least-busy device) in the Place picker — or dispatching with `autoDevice: true` — selects a paired session host automatically. OpenClaw `worker-turn` placements first prefer hosts with less admitted work relative to their worker capacity. They then compare free worker slots after accounting for dispatches still starting, breaking remaining ties by device ID. A session’s placement alone does not reserve a worker slot. Codex `remote-exec` placements do not consume worker slots, so eligible hosts are ranked by device ID alone. When no host qualifies, the error says exactly why: no session hosts paired, all disconnected, or all at capacity.

If a selected device becomes ineligible before workspace preparation begins, Auto tries up to three ranked hosts after confirming that the failed allocation is fully cleaned up. It does not replay workspace setup or work already started. Once workspace preparation is admitted, another turn filling the device's slots does not cancel it; the node checks physical capacity again when the session launches a turn. Node identity and command authorization remain checked throughout preparation.

See [Nodes](/nodes/session-hosting#host-openclaw-sessions) for the selection rules and [Control UI](/web/control-ui) for the picker.

## Sleeping and waking: idle suspension and warm images

Two profile settings turn cloud workers from always-on machines into compute that sleeps when idle:

- `suspendAfter: "2h"` — after the session has been idle for the duration, the Gateway performs the same safe stop as **Stop cloud worker…**: it reconciles the workspace first, then releases the machine. While suspended, you pay for retained snapshot storage only. The next message provisions a replacement automatically — no button to press.
- `settings.warmImage` — prepare the project's committed checkout and node runtime, then capture a reusable image before node enrollment. Later sessions for the same project and profile can start from that image; the first session does not have to stop first. Linux only, and enabled by default when the effective machine class is known and `setupEnv` is empty. Profiles that forward host environment into setup capture only when you opt in explicitly, and `settings.warmImage: false` keeps any profile cold.

For sessions sourced from a Gateway checkout, linked worktrees share a stable project identity. A warm image retains the pristine committed seed and verified runtime, while every new session gets fresh enrollment and its current workspace files. A matching seed skips origin access and a full Git pack transfer, including for private or unpublished commits. Changed commits prepare a new seed and can refresh the project's image. Repository-only sessions instead fetch on the node and can reuse machine/runtime images and verified Git seeds; they do not prepare a project image from a Gateway checkout. The first dispatch includes preparation and any needed capture; provider startup and capture costs still determine overall latency.

Each allocation keeps its original cold start or exact checkpoint choice through retries and Gateway restart. If an upgrade reports older warm-image state, follow [Upgrade warm-image state](/gateway/cloud-workers#upgrade-warm-image-state); Doctor preserves known images and cleanup obligations, and reports manual recovery steps for leases whose original choice is unknown.

Suspension never interrupts work: sessions with an active turn, queued messages, or unreconciled results are skipped and re-checked on the next sweep. See the profile fields in [Cloud Workers](/gateway/cloud-workers#configuration) for costs, capture boundaries, and prerequisites.

## What stays with the Gateway

Placement is disposable; the session is not. The transcript, the last-reconciled workspace files, placement history, and every provider credential live with the Gateway in all placements. After a clean reclaim or idle suspension, the next message provisions a replacement — warm when an image exists, cold otherwise. After a Gateway update releases an idle worker built for the previous build, the same automatic replacement applies; a worker interrupted mid-turn or holding unaccepted results still fails and needs explicit redispatch. Failed placements keep their diagnostic visible; resolve pending cleanup, then redispatch and retry. An offline paired device is different by design: the placement stays active and waits for the device to reconnect, and **Continue on Gateway…** works while the device is offline, resuming from the last Gateway-synced workspace and discarding unsynced device changes. Workspace changes made after the last reconciliation are the only loss window, and clean stops (including auto-suspension) reconcile before releasing the machine.

Repository-only checkpoint history remains until session deletion. While a worker runs, **Files** and diffs use its checkout. After Stop, changed-file previews remain available from the accepted checkpoint; editing, unchanged upstream files, and full diffs require restarting the worker. Publication can use an accepted Git-normalized checkpoint without a Gateway checkout. See [what survives a dead machine](/gateway/cloud-workers#what-survives-a-dead-machine).

Reset keeps the repository and accepted changes but ends unfinished publication requests from the previous session lifecycle. Review the retained changes and request publication again after reset. Existing GitHub commits and pull requests remain unchanged.

OpenClaw gives agents tools to work across sessions, inspect status, and orchestrate sub-agents.

`sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_search`, `session_status`,
`sessions_send`, `sessions`, and `sessions_spawn` accept optional `user` (the requester's verified `requester_profile.id`).
It is required when several people have steered the turn. The named person's
authority determines session access and child execution; unknown or revoked
participants are rejected. Single-person turns can omit it.
Scheduled jobs and SDK/plugin runs without turn participants retain their existing
session access rules.

## Available tools

| Tool                 | What it does                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessions`           | Patch, reset, delete, or assign ownership of visible sessions and manage session groups |
| `sessions_list`      | List sessions with optional filters (kind, label, agent, archive, preview)              |
| `sessions_search`    | Search visible session transcripts and return matching excerpts                         |
| `sessions_history`   | Read the transcript of a specific session                                               |
| `sessions_send`      | Run another session on the same Gateway and optionally wait                             |
| `conversations_list` | List stable external conversation addresses                                             |
| `conversations_send` | Send to one exact external conversation without running a local session                 |
| `conversations_turn` | Send to one exact external conversation and wait for its correlated reply               |
| `sessions_spawn`     | Spawn an isolated sub-agent session for background work                                 |
| `sessions_yield`     | End the current turn and wait for follow-up sub-agent results                           |
| `subagents`          | List or cancel background work in this session tree                                     |
| `session_status`     | Show a `/status`-style card and optionally set a per-session model override             |

These tools are still subject to the active tool profile and allow/deny policy. `tools.profile: "coding"` includes the full session orchestration set. `tools.profile: "messaging"` includes session self-service, discovery, recall, cross-session messaging, external-conversation tools, and the complete spawn lifecycle (`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_yield`, and `subagents`). The UI-only task-suggestion tools `suggest_task` and `dismiss_task` remain coding-profile tools.

Group, provider, sandbox, and per-agent policies can still remove those tools after the profile stage. Use `/tools` from the affected session to inspect the effective tool list.

Session access denials are rendered from the same typed visibility decision
used by the enforcement boundary. When execution audit collection is enabled
for an admitted run, a private queued fact retains the evaluated policy inputs
and an installation-local opaque target reference, not the raw target session
key. Public inspection renders that generic fact as an unverified
`decision.record`; it does not claim a trusted reason or target display. A
successful session operation is not labeled `enforced` merely because its
mechanics succeeded.

For the same admitted run, create, fork, send, patch, reset, archive, restore,
and delete results can queue attribution-only generic facts. The private facts
distinguish committed or scheduled work from typed lifecycle conflicts and
definitive no-ops; their public display remains generic and unverified. Direct
Gateway sharing operations are outside this run-audit boundary.

## Listing and reading sessions

`sessions_list` is a metadata inventory, not a transcript search. Rows include session key and ID, agent, kind, channel, title/label, sidebar group, current owner and original creator, stored project/workspace associations, visible parent/child links, archive/pin state, state version, model/token counts, and run status. Unknown associations remain absent; a stored worktree association does not prove that its checkout still exists.

Use the filters together to narrow the inventory before paging:

- `relationship`: `owned`, `created`, or `involving`, relative to the authenticated requesting user. Ownership is current responsibility; creation is original provenance; involvement means current ownership or retained prompt participation. This is not the agent's owner and does not infer identity from a session label. Without a trusted requesting-user identity, the tool rejects this filter; use an explicit `ownerId` or `creatorId` instead.
- `ownerId` and `creatorId`: exact canonical actor IDs. Relationship filters narrow visibility; they never grant access.
- `projectId` and `workspaceDir`: exact persisted project and working-directory associations. Listing does not inspect the filesystem or run Git.
- `group` and `pinned`: exact sidebar group and pin state. An empty group selects ungrouped sessions.
- `activeOnly`: current direct queued/running work on Gateway-backed inventories; it is unavailable in embedded mode without a live Gateway projection. `activeMinutes` is recency, not liveness. `excludeSubagents` omits subagent runs and ungrouped spawned sessions. Visible spawned conversations assigned to a custom group remain eligible under the normal visibility and archive filters.
- `kinds`, `label`, `agentId`, and `search`: the existing classification, exact label/agent, and metadata-text filters. Kinds are `main`, `group`, `cron`, `hook`, `node`, and `other`.
- `archived`: false or omitted selects unarchived sessions; true selects archived sessions; `"all"` includes both.

`limit` defaults to 100. Larger positive requests accepted by earlier versions remain valid, but each response applies at most 200 rows and reports that bound in `limitApplied`. `count` is the number of returned rows, not the inventory total. While `hasMore` is true, pass `nextOffset` as `offset` with the same filters. An empty page can still have a continuation. Each call is bounded to five internal pages and a 64 KiB serialized result; `truncationReason` identifies a `scan-limit` or `byte-limit` partial result. A byte-limited continuation resumes at the first omitted row.

Pages are a live view, not a frozen snapshot. Concurrent updates, pinning, reassignment, or archiving can move rows between pages. Deduplicate by agent/key/session ID; restart from offset zero when a fresh complete inventory is required. Every call reapplies access checks. A continuation is not an access grant, and the tool does not expose a global count of hidden sessions.

Transcript-derived fields are opt-in: `includeDerivedTitles`, `includeLastMessage`, or `messageLimit` (at most 20 messages per selected row). Metadata-only calls do not read transcripts or start sessions. Previews are hydrated only after session visibility filtering. If a row becomes inaccessible or its session is replaced while enrichment is in progress, it is omitted from the completed inventory. If the first enriched row cannot fit the result budget, the call returns metadata without inline messages or transcript-derived previews and sets `enrichmentOmitted: true`; use `sessions_history` for the full conversation. A metadata row that still exceeds 64 KiB fails explicitly rather than silently losing identity or associations.

Use the returned `sessionId` as `expectedSessionId` when the `sessions` tool archives, restores, or deletes a session, so a stale key cannot target a replacement. Delivery routing, detailed runtime settings, cost estimates, and transcript paths remain omitted. Restricted inventories include `visibility` metadata explaining the effective session-tool scope.

`sessions_history` fetches the conversation transcript for a specific session. By default, tool results are excluded; pass `includeTools: true` to see them. Use `limit` for the newest bounded tail. Pass `offset: 0` when you need pagination metadata, then pass returned `nextOffset` values to page backward through older OpenClaw transcript windows without reading raw transcript files. When an eligible bound external CLI transcript contributes messages, history returns a merged snapshot instead of a numeric offset page—even with an explicit `offset`. The Gateway treats these as terminal snapshots (`hasMore: false`); oversized snapshots remain byte-bounded, so terminal does not imply complete. Local offset paging applies when no external import survives. Unanchored reads stay the current reset-relative view. An explicit `messageId` that remains in that current view, including a pre-reset row kept after reset, keeps current-view behavior. An explicit `messageId` for a retained active-path row outside the current view opens that original closed interval and does not mix later post-reset turns; a missing or off-path `messageId` returns empty history rather than the newest messages.

Durably admitted inputs from `sessions_send` or the Gateway `agent` method
appear separately in `pendingInputs`, not in transcript `messages`. Each row
records `queued`, `cancelled`, or `interrupted`.
Cancelled and interrupted inputs are retained for inspection and never run
automatically. Use `pendingBefore` with the page's `nextBefore` to read older
inputs; `limit` bounds both pages. Pending previews share a 4 KB budget within
the overall 80 KB response budget, so use a smaller `limit` for richer previews.

`pendingInputs.total` counts retained, unconsumed inputs in the current physical
session before display filtering and pagination. It is not a visible-message or
runnable-job count. `items.length` is the visible count on this page. An empty
`items` array can still have `nextBefore`; follow it to inspect older entries.
Missing `nextBefore` means the inspected raw window is exhausted, not that all
retained inputs were executable. Pending metadata neither authorizes replay nor
blocks unrelated work. Execution still requires current admission and exact
input custody.

The returned view is intentionally bounded and redacted:

- credential/token-like text is redacted even when general-purpose log redaction is disabled
- thinking signatures, reasoning replay payloads, and inline image data are omitted
- long text blocks are truncated to 4000 characters, with a truncation marker appended
- returned messages are capped at 80 KB; older rows can be dropped or an oversized row replaced with `[sessions_history omitted: message too large]`
- the tool reports summary flags such as `truncated`, `droppedMessages`, `contentTruncated`, `contentRedacted`, `bytes`, and pagination metadata

This is structured history, not the plain-text rendering used by [`/subagents log`](/tools/subagents#slash-command). `sessions_history` does not apply that command's assistant prose sanitizer: reasoning tags, `<relevant-memories>` / `<relevant_memories>` scaffolding, plain-text tool-call XML (including malformed MiniMax XML), downgraded tool markers, and model control tokens can remain in returned message text. `includeTools` controls tool-result messages, not those embedded text forms.

Use the returned **session key** (like `"main"`) with `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`, and `session_status`. To reopen a search hit, also pass its `messageId` and `sessionId` to `sessions_history`; see [Session search](/concepts/session-search). Outside anchored recall, use the durable `sessionId` as the lifecycle identity described above.

If you need the exact raw transcript, inspect the scoped SQLite transcript rows instead of treating `sessions_history` as an unfiltered dump.

Use [`sessions_search`](/concepts/session-search) for exact full-text recall across visible user and assistant transcript text. Its results include a `sessionKey` for a follow-up `sessions_history` call; visibility filtering, snippet redaction, and output bounds match the history boundary.

## Managing session settings and groups

The `sessions` tool exposes bounded self-service surfaces. Gateway owners retain the full tool. An explicit non-owner sender receives `assign_owner` for visible sessions. An admitted non-admin operator with `operator.write` can archive or restore only sessions they created. They can stop sessions they created or are assigned to as a human owner, subject to existing session access checks. The narrower `operator.sessions.write` scope alone does not expose those controls. Other settings, deletion, cloud-profile discovery, and global group actions remain owner-gated. Senderless system runs keep their existing session-management surface, subject to tool policy, scopes, and live caller checks.

Explicit tool denies still remove the tool. Standalone HTTP/RPC tool invocation and session-bound MCP attach grants retain their owner gate and do not gain agent identity. Assignment without affirmative owner authority requires a live admitted agent turn, rechecked at the owner write. Tool discovery never grants access to another session; revoked authority and replaced session generations cannot be reused.

- `action: "patch"` changes the current session by default, or another visible session selected by `sessionKey`. It can set the label, persistent sidebar `icon`, custom sidebar `group`, pin/archive state, model, and thinking level. Root sessions and ordinary Home-linked dashboard sessions can be pinned; spawned, subagent, and nested-child sessions reject pin requests. Subagent runs appear in session transcripts, outside sidebar navigation. Pass `null` or an empty string to clear `group`; assigning a new name creates the group on first use. The icon accepts one emoji grapheme, one of the named icons `braces`, `book`, `monitor`, `bot`, `kanban`, and `coins`, or custom SVG markup/an SVG data URL; pass an empty string to clear it. SVGs must be self-contained, at most 16 KiB decoded, with no scripts, embedded documents, or external references. Include `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` and a `viewBox`; SVG data URLs may use percent encoding or base64. The Gateway stores a canonical SVG data URL and the Control UI renders it as an image. The Control UI custom-icon picker accepts the same inputs and shows the macOS (Control-Command-Space) or Windows (Windows-period) system emoji picker shortcut. Archiving or restoring another session requires its `sessions_list` `sessionId` as `expectedSessionId`.
- `action: "reset"` resets another visible session selected by `sessionKey`.
- `action: "stop"` stops another authorized session without archiving or deleting it. Include `expectedSessionId` from session discovery to reject a replacement, and optionally `runId` to stop only that exact run. Session-wide stop clears queued follow-ups by default; pass `clearQueued: false` to retain them. Exact-run stop cannot clear unrelated queued follow-ups. To stop the calling session, finish its current reply instead. Non-interactive Swarm collectors do not receive Stop; their existing archive and other session operations are unchanged.
- `action: "delete"` first archives and then deletes the exact same generation of another visible session selected by `sessionKey`. By default its transcript is retained as a deleted archive; pass `deleteTranscript: false` to leave the transcript state untouched. Resetting or deleting the session currently running the tool is rejected.
- `action: "assign_owner"` hands session responsibility to a person or agent. Pass `ownerType` (`"human"` or `"agent"`) and `ownerId`; the target is the current session by default, or another visible session via `sessionKey`. Agent owner ids must name a configured agent. The assignment records who reassigned it and when, and the Control UI reflects the new owner immediately. A human assignment also selects that person’s personal instructions on later eligible turns, without changing the requester’s identity or privileges. Ownership is not access control; see [assigning an owner](/concepts/multi-user#assigning-an-owner).
- `group_list`, `group_set`, `group_rename`, and `group_delete` manage the global ordered session-group catalog. `group_set` (`names`) declaratively replaces the catalog: array order becomes sidebar order, new names are created, and existing empty groups left out of the list are deleted — reorder by passing the complete current list in the new order, and prefer `group_delete` to remove a single group. `group_set` never moves sessions; use `action: "patch"` with `group` for selected memberships. `group_rename` updates all member categories, and `group_delete` clears them. `group_set` rejects dropping a group that still has member sessions; use `group_delete` first.

Interrupted group rename/delete operations retain groups needed by remaining
members. A rename can leave both source and destination groups visible; retry
the operation to finish moving the remaining members.

To apply the same patch to several sessions, pass `targets` with 1–100
`{ sessionKey, expectedSessionId? }` objects instead of top-level `sessionKey`
and `expectedSessionId`. For example:

```json
{
  "action": "patch",
  "targets": [
    { "sessionKey": "agent:main:dashboard:review-api" },
    { "sessionKey": "agent:main:dashboard:review-ui" }
  ],
  "group": "Reviews"
}
```

Each target uses the same visibility rules as a single patch. Supply its
`sessions_list` `sessionId` as `expectedSessionId` to reject a stale selection;
archive and restore require this identity for every target. Valid targets can
succeed when another target fails. The result's `succeeded` and `failed` arrays
contain zero-based indexes into `targets`; bounded `errors` explain failures.
An explicit warning identifies omitted error details. Retry those failed targets
individually when more detail is needed. Duplicate targets that pass these checks
reject the batch before mutation. To archive an eligible current session, use a single patch;
its archive is deferred until the run finishes, while a batch reports that
current-session target as failed and continues with the others.

Use `sessions_spawn` with `visible: true` to create a persistent dashboard session. Pass `group` to place it in a sidebar group atomically; omit `group` or pass an empty string to leave it ungrouped. This keeps session creation on the controlled spawn path, which enforces the parent's tool policy, sandbox, concurrency limits, and run timeout.

If startup or registration fails, cleanup removes only the child created by that spawn. A session reset or replaced meanwhile is preserved. When cleanup cannot be confirmed, the error includes the child session key for inspection before retrying.

An agent-selected model patch stays reversible until that selection completes a successful run. If the selected model is definitively unusable because of authentication, billing, or model-not-found failure, OpenClaw restores the previous model and writes a visible system note. Transient rate-limit, overload, timeout, network, and server failures do not undo the selection.

## Sessions versus conversations

A **session** is local model context. A **conversation** is an exact external address such as one peer, channel, or thread. The two are linked, but they are not interchangeable: direct messages can share one `main` session while retaining separate conversation addresses.

`conversations_list` returns opaque `conversationRef` values for the active agent. With an explicit `channel`, the Gateway also refreshes addresses from that channel's local directory, such as approved Reef peers; use `query` to find a specific peer beyond the current result page. Discovery catalogs the address without creating a model-context session; the backing session is created only when delivery or inbound context needs it. Conversation discovery and delivery are owner-only because they use the Gateway's channel credentials. Use `conversations_send` for fire-and-forget delivery. Use `conversations_turn` when the remote reply belongs to the current model turn: the Gateway reserves one transport message ID, persists a delivery operation and queue intent before transport I/O, and returns the correlated reply from the tool instead of starting a second local agent turn. Delivery operations live outside model transcripts; a captured reply is retained only as a side artifact while the tool result owns model context. If the Gateway restarts after queueing, delivery can recover but a later reply follows ordinary inbound dispatch because the process-local waiter is gone. Unsolicited inbound messages always continue through the normal channel dispatch path.

Use the shared `message` tool when you already have an explicit raw channel target or need a channel-specific action. Conversation references are scoped to the active agent and should be obtained through `conversations_list`, not constructed from session keys.

In Code Mode, the conversation tools reuse their exact Gateway output contracts. A single `exec` cell can list addresses, select a returned `conversationRef`, and call `conversations_send` or `conversations_turn`; normal tool policy and approvals still apply to the nested calls.

## Sending cross-session messages

Supply the message body in the required `message` argument. Hidden aliases such as `SendMessage`, `content`, and `text` are not accepted.

`sessions_send` runs another session on the same Gateway and optionally waits for the response. Its `sessionKey`, `label`, or `agentId` selects local model context, not an external destination. A peer's reply reaches the requester once, either inline or as a later inter-session input. Continue the conversation with another `sessions_send`. To post to a channel, use `message` with an explicit channel and target.

Sessions keep their addresses when execution moves between the Gateway, a paired device, and a cloud worker. An OpenClaw worker can send to an authorized parent, child, or sibling using its exact session key, including a target running on the Gateway. The Gateway validates the current session identities and normal visibility policy before admitting the target turn; target placement does not grant messaging access. Targets outside the configured visibility scope, archived targets, and replaced targets remain denied.

During healthy worker provisioning or workspace preparation, accepted input stays queued until the intended worker is ready. It starts once after OpenClaw rechecks the session and placement. Cancellation, failed setup, or a replaced destination does not silently run that input locally or on another worker. Check the retained input and setup error before submitting another message.

- **Fire-and-forget:** set `timeoutSeconds: 0` to enqueue and return immediately.
- **Wait for reply:** set a timeout and get the response inline.
- **Guide your running child:** with no `mode` and `timeoutSeconds: 0`, a send to your own spawned child steers into its active run and acknowledges queue admission, like `mode: "steer"`, not persistence or model consumption. This admission is not restart-durable. Use `mode: "followup"` for a separate child turn with its own completion. An idle child or one whose run rejects the steer starts a new turn. Explicit modes keep their existing behavior.
- **Continue a paused child task:** send the continuation without `mode`. When the caller controls a native child paused by `sessions_yield` with task-owned completion, the runtime resumes that task automatically, preserving its identity and original completion recipient. Use `mode: "resume"` to require this behavior explicitly. An explicit `mode: "followup"` starts a separate turn and leaves the paused task intact.

A separate follow-up to your native child starts only after Gateway admission
and input preparation. If admission rejects the turn, the send returns an error
and the turn does not start. A requested state watch is installed only after
successful admission.

For native-child followups with in-process one-way result delivery, yielding to
accepted children keeps the same logical result obligation. Its exact admitted continuation returns
one final result; an empty yielded predecessor is not a completed `no_reply`.
A positive wait can transfer to asynchronous delivery without a second consumer.
This custody is process-local: it does not restore caller authority after a
Gateway restart, and it closes when that authority or either conversation changes.
An owner-started follow-up also retains the original channel owner identity for
its one-way result turn in the same requester conversation. Successful results
and child failures can therefore continue already authorized work with owner-only
plugin tools. This does not make the child an owner or treat its text as a user
instruction. A new user turn, revoked ownership, changed conversation, or Gateway
restart invalidates the retained authority.
The original paused child task remains separate from an explicit followup.

Retries with the same input ID reconcile retained Gateway admission and reply
receipts before admitting another execution.

Task resume returns `status: "accepted"`, `mode: "resume"`, the successor `runId`,
the original `taskRunId`, and `completion: "task"`. The existing task owner delivers
the eventual result once; the tool does not wait for the answer or start a separate
reply delivery. Automatic resume accepts ordinary `watch` and `timeoutSeconds`
arguments but leaves all result delivery with the existing task instead of adding
an inline wait or a second watcher. Explicit `mode: "resume"` rejects `watch: true`
and positive waits. Resume requires trusted in-process
Gateway admission. Unrelated callers, completed tasks, and changed child sessions
are rejected rather than falling back to ordinary messaging.
Controller ownership remains bound to the originally recorded session store.
Retained tasks created without store provenance keep ordinary default messaging
and their existing explicit resume and cancellation controls. Newly registered
tasks record their store and can use automatic continuation.

`timeoutSeconds` limits the sending tool's wait, not the receiver's execution
budget. For nonblocking coordination, use `sessions_send` with `timeoutSeconds: 0`.
When that wait expires, eligible pending reply delivery continues observing the accepted
run until it finishes; a wait interval does not discard a late reply. Nested
inter-session replies use the same completion observation.
The low-level Gateway `sessions.send` RPC has a different contract: its JSON
`timeoutMs` limits **receiver execution**, just like `chat.send`. Omit that field
to keep the receiver's configured budget; bound the CLI wait separately with
[`gateway call --timeout`](/cli/gateway/query#gateway-call-%3Cmethod%3E).

An accepted result keeps target admission separate from reply delivery.
`targetDisposition` is `queued` for a new turn or `steered` for an active turn, including default sends with no reply wait to your own running child;
`delivery.status` describes only the later reply delivery as `pending` or `skipped`.
An inline reply has `delivery.status: "skipped"` and starts no additional requester turn.
Neither field is a target-completion receipt.
Default zero-wait sends to your own running child acknowledge queue admission,
like `mode: "steer"`; they do not confirm transcript persistence or model consumption
and are not restart-durable. They produce no separate completion turn. Use
`mode: "followup"` when you need that separate child turn and completion.

If an idempotent retry finds that the original admission is still pending, the
tool returns an error with `sentBeforeError: true` and the existing run ID, without
installing a watch. Inspect that run before retrying.

Replies come from the completed run's terminal result. When a same-session
target has already delivered its final reply to the source conversation through
`message`, OpenClaw skips the duplicate source-channel reply. Progress messages
and replies stored only in the internal UI do not count as external delivery.
When a same-session follow-up still needs source-channel delivery, its reply preserves
the requesting turn's channel, account, recipient, and thread when available.
Later messages can update the session's stored route without redirecting the
accepted reply, including when an identity link hides the address from the session key.

Each completed same-session reply is queued separately for that original session
generation. Later ordinary turns and other completed replies do not cancel it.
Resetting, deleting, or replacing the original session stops replies that have not
started sending; a send already handed to the channel keeps its normal outcome.
The queue can recover a completed reply after restart. This does not make an
unfinished model run or its in-memory reply observer restartable.

Older versions that do not recognize these queue entries leave them and their
attachments pending while continuing ordinary work. Return to a supporting
version to resume delivery. Full state backups include queued attachments;
database-only backups do not. Backup restoration intentionally omits pending
delivery records and does not resume these replies.

A waited send that finishes without visible assistant text returns `status: "no_reply"`; no reply delivery remains pending. If the target delivered its final reply directly, the result says so and tells the caller not to resend. Otherwise, continue without waiting or send a new message if a response is required.

Thread-scoped chat sessions, such as keys ending in `:thread:<id>`, are not valid `sessions_send` targets. Use the parent channel session key for inter-agent coordination so tool-routed messages do not appear inside an active human-facing thread.

Messages and delayed replies are marked as inter-session data in the receiving prompt (`[Inter-session message ... isUser=false]`) and in transcript provenance. The receiving agent should treat them as tool-routed data, not as a direct end-user-authored instruction.

Agent shell commands must not substitute operator CLI message RPCs for this
path. With the inherited `OPENCLAW_SHELL=exec` marker, the CLI rejects
`sessions.send`, `sessions.steer`, `chat.send`, `agent`, and `sessions.create`
requests containing an initial message, task, or attachment. Use the session tool
when available; a subagent without it should return its result through normal
completion. A delivery failure does not authorize switching to the operator CLI.
This check prevents accidental loss of attribution; the environment marker is
not authentication or isolation from other processes running as the same OS user.

Peers and Control UI requesters receive the settled reply once. The requester response is not fed back into the target, and no target announcement turn is generated. Delivery to the target's own channel does not suppress a distinct requester's reply.

Nonblocking sends retain the requester's reply authority before returning. Finishing
the requester turn does not cancel the accepted reply; access revocation or Gateway
replacement still stops it.

A child report also goes to its recipient once, without an automatic acknowledgment turn in the child. An explicitly waiting caller can still receive the recipient's reply inline. For a new child turn, the child's reply returns inline or is delivered once after the wait expires, with subagent completion provenance and custody preserved.

Isolated scheduled jobs can wait for an inline reply, but receive no detached reply turns or failure notifications. A send from such a job does not generate a target announcement either; separately registered task completion retains its own delivery owner.

These reply deliveries apply to new or follow-up turns. Default sends with no reply wait to your own running child skip separate reply delivery and leave completion with the active run's owner. `mode: "steer"` returns admission only for guidance added to an active run and leaves completion with that run's existing owner. It uses the existing `sessions_send` access checks. For the built-in runtime, a busy tool or model response can delay transcript persistence until the next steering boundary; the send's reply-wait deadline does not withdraw admitted guidance. Acceptance is not proof of transcript persistence or model consumption, and does not make the in-memory steering queue restart-durable. The receiving run retains source authority until the input settles or that exact run ends or aborts; a missing backend settlement callback cannot retain it past the run. Existing explicit cancellation, run-lifecycle, and authorization rules still apply. `mode: "notify"` queues context without starting a turn. Registered task completion and paused-task resume keep their existing completion owner and do not add a second reply delivery.

An operator with `operator.sessions.write` can use `mode: "notify"` for an authorized session they own, including an owned child. Notifications retain the requester's current authority and target-session checks before queueing. They remain in memory and do not start a run.

Child coordination stays in agent context and raw transcripts. The receiving chat hides child reports and automatic coordination replies, while normal task-completion summaries and direct human answers remain visible. Historical messages without source provenance cannot be classified as child traffic.

Pass `watch: true` to also register the sender as a state-change watcher of the target: when another actor later sends the target a direct human message or changes its goal, the sender receives a system notice pointing at `session_status` `changesSince`. Registration happens after successful dispatch, targets the session that actually received the message, and starts at its current state version, so only later changes produce notices. The result reports `watched: true` when registration succeeded. See [Session state awareness](/concepts/session-state).

Every nonblocking follow-up to your existing native child gives the current
requester turn a completion claim before the tool returns; `watch` is not required.
Call `sessions_yield` after acceptance to wait for that completion, including
when the follow-up is queued behind the child's active run. The normal child
settlement path delivers the result once. Sends without a requester turn keep
the ordinary reply-delivery behavior. A watched steer can claim an existing child's
pending announcing completion for the current turn without creating another
completion or changing the child's task identity.
If steering was admitted but its completion can no longer be claimed, the tool
returns an error with `sentBeforeError: true`. Inspect the target before retrying;
the guidance was already admitted.

## Status and orchestration helpers

`session_status` is the lightweight `/status`-equivalent tool for the current or another visible session. It reports usage, time, model/runtime state, and linked background-task context when present. Like `/status`, it can backfill sparse token/cache counters from the latest transcript usage entry, and `model=default` clears a per-session override. Use `sessionKey="current"` for the caller's current session; visible client labels such as `openclaw-tui` are not session keys.

Model changes stay scoped to the selected session and do not update the agent's or global default. Gateway-managed sessions apply the same model, runtime, and execution-environment checks as other session model selections. Repeating an unchanged choice does not update session activity or emit model-change notifications.

When route metadata is available, `session_status` also includes a visible `Route context` JSON block and matching structured `details` fields. These fields disambiguate the session key from the route that is currently handling the live run:

- `origin` is where the session was created, or the provider inferred from a deliverable session-key prefix when older state lacks stored origin metadata.
- `active` is the current live-run route. It is only reported for the live or current session being handled now.
- `deliveryContext` is the persisted delivery route stored on the session, which OpenClaw can reuse for later delivery even when the active surface differs.

## Session state changes

OpenClaw keeps a durable signal log of material session state changes (direct human messages to watched sessions, child-run outcomes, goal changes, compaction). `sessions_list` rows and `session_status` expose the session's `stateVersion`, and `session_status` accepts `changesSince: <version>` to return the typed events after that version, with exact `historyGap` signaling when the requested version predates retained history. Watchers — spawn parents automatically, `sessions_send watch: true` explicitly — receive one coalesced stale-state notice when another actor changes a watched session.

State-change events omit repeated session/agent IDs and expose only model-useful payload fields (`outcome`, `channel`, or `turns`). The event summary and actor/run identifiers remain available for reconciliation.

See [Session state awareness](/concepts/session-state) for the full model: event kinds, watcher registration, the anti-spam notice protocol, reconciliation flow, and current limits.

`sessions_yield` intentionally ends the current turn so the next message can be an announced child completion event. Use it for announcing sub-agents, not [Swarm collectors](/tools/swarm): collectors require explicit result collection through `agents_wait` or an awaited `agents.run()` in OpenClaw Code Mode, and send no completion notification.

`subagents` lists native subagent runs within the controlled session tree. Use the returned `runId` with `action: "wait"` or `action: "cancel"`; cancellation does not grant access to unrelated sessions. ACP, media, shell processes, and cron retain their own status and cancellation owners.

## Spawning sub-agents

`sessions_spawn` creates a separate session for a background task. Non-thread spawns start with isolated context by default; thread-bound spawns follow the configured context policy described below. It returns a `runId` and `childSessionKey` when startup is accepted, without waiting for the child task to finish. Spawns from an OpenClaw cloud worker can first wait for child provisioning and node enrollment. Native sub-agent runs receive their delegated task in a `[Subagent Task]` message appended after any forked history; inherited task envelopes are context, not the current child's assignment. The system prompt carries only sub-agent runtime rules and routing context.

Key options:

- `runtime: "subagent"` (default) or `"acp"` for external harness agents.
- `model` and `thinking` overrides for the child session.
- `runTimeoutSeconds` to override the configured child-run timeout; `0` disables it.
- `thread: true` to bind the spawn to a chat thread (Discord, Slack, etc.).
- `sandbox: "require"` to enforce sandboxing on the child.
- `context: "fork"` when the child needs the current requester transcript; this requires `runtime: "subagent"` and the same agent as the requester, whether the child is hidden or visible. Use `context: "isolated"` explicitly for a clean child. Omission means isolated context for non-thread spawns; thread-bound native sub-agents follow `threadBindings.defaultSpawnContext`, which defaults to `fork`.
- `visible: true` to create a persistent dashboard session instead of a hidden sub-agent session. Visible spawns support an explicit sidebar `group`, model, working directory, same-agent transcript fork, and an optional [managed worktree](/concepts/managed-worktrees); see [Sub-agents](/tools/subagents#tool-parameters) for the exact compatibility limits. The accepted result is a receipt: it includes the child session key, run id, a Control UI `sessionUrl` (omitted when the Control UI is disabled), and an `owner` record naming the stored owner. When the active human requester matches the requesting session's verified human owner, a new visible child inherits that person as owner. Otherwise, the owner falls back to the requesting agent. The requesting agent is normally the immutable creator; a required sandbox instead preserves the parent's creator provenance as an isolation policy. When acknowledging the spawn in a channel, put the session URL on the first line and `Owner: <label>` on the second. Ownership controls responsibility and display, not creator-based access; see [Multi-user mode](/concepts/multi-user#agent-spawned-sessions).

Sub-agents below the default depth limit of `5` receive `sessions_spawn`, `subagents`, `sessions_list`, and `sessions_history` so they can manage their own children. Set a lower `maxSpawnDepth` to turn sessions at that depth into leaves sooner.

Ordinary announcing runs return a completion event to the requester. Follow the accepted receipt for other completion modes: collectors require explicit collection, directly routed thread sessions reply in the bound thread, and quiet runs send no completion notification. Announce delivery preserves bound thread/topic routing when available, and if the completion origin only identifies a channel, OpenClaw can still reuse the requester session's stored route (`lastChannel` / `lastTo`) for direct delivery.

For ACP-specific behavior, see [ACP Agents](/tools/acp-agents).

## Visibility

Session tools are scoped to limit what the agent can see:

| Level   | Scope                                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self`  | Only the current session                                          |
| `tree`  | Current + spawned; when called from main, all same-agent sessions |
| `agent` | All sessions for this agent                                       |
| `all`   | All sessions (cross-agent access is on by default)                |

Default is `all`: unsandboxed sessions, including retained cron sessions, can
list, read, search, message, and inspect status across agents on the Gateway.
This can include other users' transcripts. Cross-agent access is on by default
and governed by `tools.agentToAgent`; set `enabled: false` to block ordinary
cross-agent access or use `allow` to restrict permitted agent pairs; requester-owned native subagent and ACP child sessions stay reachable under `tree` or `all` either way. Set `agent` for same-agent-only
access, or `tree` for current plus spawned scope; its canonical main-session
exception still covers all same-agent sessions. Set `self` for strict
current-session access, including main.

The `agent` scope does not include children owned by another agent.
Keep explicit `tree` when relying on its owned native/ACP child exception, or
use the default `all` with the appropriate `tools.agentToAgent` policy. A sandboxed
caller under the default spawned-only session
tool clamp stays limited to its spawn subtree. Incognito sessions remain hidden
from every cross-session tool. Ambient group watches still add activity notices
and prompt hints; they do not grant access.

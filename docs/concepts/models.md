A model ref (`provider/model`) chooses a provider and model, not the low-level
agent runtime. With runtime policy unset or `auto`, OpenAI's provider-owned
route policy may select Codex only for an exact official HTTPS Platform
Responses or ChatGPT Responses route with no authored request override. The
`openai/*` prefix alone never selects Codex. Completions adapters, custom
endpoints, and authored request behavior stay on OpenClaw. Plaintext official
HTTP endpoints are rejected. See [OpenAI implicit agent runtime](/providers/openai/runtimes#implicit-agent-runtime).

Subscription Copilot refs (`github-copilot/*`) can be opted into the external
GitHub Copilot agent runtime plugin, but that path is always explicit (never
selected by `auto`). Runtime overrides belong on provider/model policy, not on
the whole agent or session. Runtime selection does not determine billing:
OpenAI API-key and ChatGPT/Codex subscription credentials remain distinct. See
[Agent runtimes](/concepts/agent-runtimes) and
[GitHub Copilot agent runtime](/plugins/copilot).

</Steps>

Related model-config surfaces:

- `agents.defaults.models` stores aliases and per-model settings. After legacy-policy migration, adding an entry does not restrict model overrides.
- `agents.defaults.modelSelectionScope` chooses the scope of chat commands and Gateway session model updates without an explicit scope. The default is the current session. See [Model selection scope](/gateway/config-agents/models#agentsdefaultsmodelselectionscope).
- `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` is the optional override allowlist. Use exact refs or trailing prefix wildcards such as `provider/*` and `provider/namespace/*`. Omit it or set `[]` to allow any model. Per-agent `agents.entries.*.modelPolicy.allow` replaces the default policy for that agent.
- `agents.defaults.utilityModel` is an optional lower-cost model for short internal tasks. Those tasks include generated dashboard session titles, supported channel thread or topic titles, progress narration, and rolling [Activity recaps](/web/control-ui/settings#activity-tab). Per-agent `agents.entries.*.utilityModel` overrides it. When unset, OpenClaw uses the primary provider's declared small-model default when one exists (OpenAI → `gpt-5.6-luna`, Anthropic → `claude-haiku-4-5`), otherwise the agent's primary model. Set it to an empty string to disable utility routing. Generated titles retry once with the primary model when a distinct utility model fails. For dashboard titles, automatic utility derivation and the regular fallback follow the effective session provider and auth profile. An explicit utility model keeps its configured provider and auth. An empty utility model skips only the alternate small-model route, not dashboard title generation. Utility tasks are separate model calls and may send bounded task content to the selected model provider. Activity recaps use bounded transcript excerpts and the previous recap, preserve cached text on failure, and do not fall back to the primary model.
- `agents.defaults.decisionModel` selects a plugin's typed decision model as `provider/model` for choices, scores, and boolean probabilities. It is disabled when unset or empty. Per-agent `agents.entries.*.decisionModel` inherits when unset and disables decisions when empty. The Control UI has a separate **Decision** picker beside Utility; decision models never appear in chat, primary, fallback, or utility choices. Supporting plugins call the [decision runtime](/plugins/sdk-overview/capabilities#decision-models-contract-version-1); selection alone does not start background work or replace the chat model.
- `agents.defaults.imageModel` is used only when the primary model cannot accept images.
- `agents.defaults.pdfModel` is used by the `pdf` tool. If unset, the tool falls back to `imageModel`, then the resolved session/default model.
- `agents.defaults.mediaModels.{image,music,video}` backs the shared media-generation tools. If unset, each tool infers an auth-backed provider default: current default provider first, then the remaining registered providers for that capability in provider-id order. Cross-provider fallback is the fixed default behavior.
- Per-agent `agents.entries.*.model` (plus bindings) overrides `agents.defaults.model` — see [Multi-agent routing](/concepts/multi-agent).

Explicit `modelPolicy.allow` restrictions were introduced in v2026.8.1. For legacy model maps, `openclaw doctor --fix` copies the complete restriction into `modelPolicy.allow` when every ref is valid. When one supported include file owns the repair, Doctor updates that file and preserves its ancestor include directives, including during an update. Repairs spanning multiple owners still require editing the owning files. If any ref needs provider qualification, Doctor preserves the entire legacy restriction and reports how to set an explicit policy. Until then, model-map edits still change the legacy restriction. No keys are silently dropped, and no empty policy is substituted for an unresolved restriction.

Removing an explicit default model policy from an included config preserves an empty `modelPolicy: {}`. This keeps the policy unrestricted when aliases or model settings are added later.

## Selection source and fallback strictness

The same `provider/model` behaves differently depending on where it came from:

| Source                                               | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configured default (`agents.defaults.model.primary`) | Normal native starting point; uses `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Native agent primary                                 | Strict unless the agent supplies `model.fallbacks`; an explicit `[]` disables fallback.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ACP agent primary                                    | Selects the external harness model. Native calls use the configured native default and inherit its fallback list unless the agent supplies `model.fallbacks`. Explicit native session and subagent selections still apply.                                     |
| Auto fallback                                        | Temporary recovery state, stored as `modelOverrideSource: "auto"`. OpenClaw periodically reprobes the original primary, clears the auto selection on recovery, and announces fallback/recovery transitions once per state change.                              |
| User session selection                               | Exact and strict. `/model`, the model picker, `session_status(model=...)`, and `sessions.patch` store `modelOverrideSource: "user"`. If that provider/model becomes unreachable, the run fails visibly instead of falling through to another configured model. |
| Cron `--model` / payload `model`                     | Per-job primary. Still uses configured fallbacks unless the job supplies its own payload `fallbacks` (`fallbacks: []` forces a strict run).                                                                                                                    |

Other selection rules:

- Changing `agents.defaults.model.primary` does not rewrite existing session pins. If status reports `This session is pinned to X; config primary Y will apply to new/unpinned sessions.`, run `/model default` to clear the pin.
- CLI default-model and allowlist pickers respect `models.mode: "replace"` by listing only `models.providers.*.models` instead of the full built-in catalog.
- The Control UI starts from the Gateway's prepared configured model view, so opening chat does not start provider discovery. Opening the chat model picker reads published rows, including rows matched by a trailing `provider/*` policy entry. Use its explicit Refresh action to discover provider models. Default and configured picker views hide catalog rows marked `deprecated` or `disabled`. There is one exception: a row stays visible when that exact model is configured as a primary, fallback, utility or tool model, alias or settings key, or exact policy entry. Hidden rows remain selectable by exact `provider/model` ref. The full built-in catalog, including hidden rows, is reserved for explicit browse views (`models.list` with `view: "all"`, or `openclaw models list --all`).
- Provider inventory UIs use `models.list` with `view: "provider-config"` to show source-authored `models.providers.*.models` rows without applying picker allowlists.

The Gateway prepares one model catalog for the CLI, `/models`, the Control UI,
and native apps. Ordinary browsing and opening or reopening a model picker read
the published catalog without starting provider discovery.

If preparing a large fleet takes longer than the two-minute startup budget, the
Gateway starts with the agent model runtimes that have finished preparing. A
warning names the remaining agents and acquisition stage, including workspace
plugins when known. `openclaw health --json` and the Gateway `status` RPC report
`modelRuntime.degraded` and `modelRuntime.pendingAgents`. Preparation continues
in the background; each completed agent becomes available, and the degraded
status clears when the full publication finishes. An unfinished agent cannot
serve model requests until its runtime and authentication facts are ready.

After sign-in, starter models are available immediately. While the Gateway
discovers account models, a small spinner in the picker’s search field indicates
a background refresh. Hover, focus, or tap it to see which providers are refreshing;
existing models stay usable, and the open picker updates when discovery completes.
An empty picker shows “Loading models…” until its first models arrive.
Gateway startup and credential changes
also refresh the affected catalog. Use **Refresh** in Models or
`openclaw models list --refresh` to request another refresh, including newly
released models. **Retry** requests discovery again after a failure.

For models configured to use a CLI runtime, channel picker availability follows that
runtime's prepared authentication. A provider API key does not substitute for its
native login.

If discovery fails, **Settings > Models** and `openclaw models list` report the
failure and keep the last compatible model list. Without one, OpenClaw shows
prepared starter models. Chat and native Quick Chat model pickers keep usable
choices without a catalog-wide warning; selected-model availability still applies.
Other providers can still update. A successful empty response clears that
provider's discovered models; it does not restore old choices. Explicitly
configured models and independent native runtime catalogs remain.

Changes to aliases or model restrictions reuse compatible inventory. Changes to
the provider, plugin, credentials, environment, or workspace can invalidate it.

Automations and command-palette model search show a warning when a provider refresh
fails, while keeping the models returned by the Gateway. Open Models to retry the
refresh. A successful empty result clears the discovered choices and warning.

A successful provider result takes precedence over retained rows, even when
another credential reports failure.

Full mechanics: [Model failover](/concepts/model-failover).

## Quick model policy

- Set your primary to the strongest latest-generation model available to you.
- Use fallbacks for cost/latency-sensitive tasks and lower-stakes chat.
- For tool-enabled agents or untrusted inputs, avoid older/weaker model tiers.

## Onboarding

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

Sets up model and auth for common providers without hand-editing config, including OpenAI Codex subscription OAuth and Anthropic (API key or Claude CLI reuse).

With no primary model configured, fresh OpenAI API-key and ChatGPT/Codex OAuth
setup select the exact `openai/gpt-6-astra` catalog ref. The bare direct-API
`openai/gpt-5.6` alias remains supported and resolves to the Sol tier.
Reauthentication preserves an existing explicit primary model, including
`openai/gpt-5.5`. If GPT-5.6 is unavailable to the account, select
`openai/gpt-5.5` explicitly. OpenClaw does not silently downgrade it.

## "Model is not allowed" (and why replies stop)

When `modelPolicy.allow` is omitted or empty, you can select an explicit
`provider/model` even when it is absent from the finite `/model` picker catalog.
The catalog supplies browse choices and model metadata. It is not an implicit
allowlist. Provider availability, runtime compatibility, and authentication are
checked independently. An unrestricted policy does not make an unknown
provider or an unsupported runtime usable. If the policy is omitted, unmigrated
legacy model-map restrictions described above still apply.

Aliases and policy entries do not prove that a model works on a provider endpoint.
Native endpoints need a supported model definition or provider-owned resolution.
Explicit custom and local endpoints can use unlisted model names. Subagent spawns
check the same support before creating child state. An automatic selection keeps
its original primary and fallback order when at least one candidate is supported.

The same policy applies to explicit `provider/model` and configured-alias hints
after `/new` or `/reset`. Unrecognized leading text stays in the prompt.

If `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` is non-empty, it becomes the allowlist for `/model`, session overrides, and `--model`. Selecting a model outside that allowlist returns before any normal reply is generated. A per-agent `agents.entries.*.modelPolicy.allow` replaces the default policy for that agent.

An exact entry permits only that model. Configured defaults and automatic
fallbacks do not grant extra manual choices. Updated pickers use the same
policy as explicit model commands while retaining current-model controls.
Older clients can still show a forbidden choice; the server rejects its selection.
Resetting to Default clears the session pin
and keeps the existing automatic selection behavior.

```text
Model override "provider/model" is not allowed by agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow.
Add "provider/model", "provider/*", or a narrower "provider/namespace/*" prefix to agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow, or remove/empty the list to allow any model.
```

Fix it by adding the model or a provider wildcard to the named `modelPolicy.allow` key, removing/emptying that list, or picking a model from `/model list`. If the rejected command included a runtime override such as `/model openai/gpt-5.5 --runtime codex`, fix the allowlist first, then retry the same command.

For local/GGUF models, the allowlist needs the full provider-prefixed ref, for example `ollama/gemma4:26b` or `lmstudio/Gemma4-26b-a4-it-gguf` — check `openclaw models list --provider <provider>` for the exact string. Bare filenames or display names are not enough once the allowlist is active.

To limit providers without listing every model, use trailing prefix wildcard entries. A provider-wide `provider/*` matches every model under that provider. A narrower prefix such as `clawrouter/anthropic/*` matches only that namespace:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      modelPolicy: {
        allow: ["openai/*", "vllm/*"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`/model`, `/models`, and model pickers then show the discovered catalog for those providers only, and new models can appear without editing the allowlist. Mix exact `provider/model` entries with `provider/*` entries to pull in one specific model from another provider.

Example allowlist with aliases and per-model settings:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" },
      modelPolicy: {
        allow: ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6", "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"],
      },
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6": { alias: "Sonnet" },
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": { alias: "Opus" },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

<Accordion title="Edit the allowlist explicitly">
Set the complete list directly:

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow '["openai/gpt-5.4","anthropic/*"]' --strict-json
```

`openclaw models set`, provider setup, and `openclaw models aliases add` can add entries under `agents.defaults.models`, but they never change `modelPolicy.allow`. This keeps model metadata and aliases independent from override policy.

### Choose the same model with different runtimes

Set `pickerRuntimes` on an exact model entry to offer additional runtime choices
in the Control UI. The entries share the model name and differ by their harness
label. The configured `agentRuntime` remains the default:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      models: {
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol": {
          agentRuntime: { id: "openclaw" },
          pickerRuntimes: ["codex"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The Gateway keeps one canonical model and checks each additional runtime against
the current account, route, and enabled harness. A choice does not grant access,
change credentials, or rename the upstream model. Each runtime supplies its own
availability, reasoning controls, context window, and placement capabilities.
Additional choices must also support explicit session runtime selection; a
registered harness that cannot be selected explicitly remains disabled here.
ACP sessions keep their existing model controls; they cannot select a different
harness here.
Catalog preparation and explicit Refresh acquire the requested native inventories
once per runtime while preserving the configured default.
Opening the picker reuses prepared catalog facts; explicit Refresh owns discovery.

An agent can replace the inherited list through
`agents.entries.<id>.models["provider/model"].pickerRuntimes`; an empty array removes
the additional choices for that agent. Lists accept up to eight explicit runtime
IDs. Duplicate runtimes and the default runtime appear only once. Wildcard model
keys and `auto` or `default` runtime IDs are not supported here.
</Accordion>

## Choose a model for a session

In the Control UI chat model menu, search by model or provider name. Use the
arrow keys to move through results and Enter to select one. Escape clears the
search. Typing alone does not change the selected model.

Gateway `sessions.create` and `sessions.patch` resolve model aliases and
`modelPolicy.allow` in the target session's agent scope. An explicit per-agent
allowlist replaces the shared default, including `[]` to allow any model.
Policy permission does not supply provider credentials or guarantee that the
selected model is available to its runtime.

Before saving a model selection, these Gateway methods check that any required
embedded harness has an installed, activatable plugin. A missing or disabled
plugin rejects the change and preserves the previous session selection and
configured default. Install and enable the named harness plugin, restart the
Gateway, then select the model again. This check does not start the runtime or
verify provider credentials.

If an existing session's harness becomes unavailable, the failed turn reports
the owner plugin when known and its activation or loading blocker. Follow the error's
`openclaw doctor --fix` or `openclaw plugins inspect <id> --runtime --json`
guidance, fix the plugin, and restart the Gateway before retrying. Gateway
health probes remain independent of model execution. Use [Models status](/cli/models)
and [Doctor](/gateway/doctor) to diagnose the configured route.

Choose the model when you create a session whenever possible. The Control UI's
**New Chat** composer includes the model picker for this reason: a fresh session
gives the selected model a clean conversation boundary.

Changing the model for an established session is an advanced operation. The
session transcript remains available, but the next model may have a different
context window, prompt and tool behavior, or prompt-cache implementation. A
mid-session switch can therefore reduce continuity, require earlier compaction,
or lose prompt-cache reuse and increase latency or cost. For a planned model
change, prefer a new session. Use `/model` or the active-session model picker
when you intentionally want the existing transcript to continue with another
model.

Keep the thinking or reasoning level stable for the session when cache reuse
matters. On OpenAI, changing the reasoning effort changes the reusable request
state and can force the next turn to process the full conversation again. Other
providers may also include thinking configuration in their cache identity, so
changing only the thinking level can increase latency and input-token cost even
when the model itself stays the same.

Retained reasoning is model-bound on current Claude models. Moving a session
off Claude Fable 5.1 continues without Fable's earlier thinking, moving onto it
keeps the thinking of Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8, and Fable 5, and switching
away and back or changing `/think` invalidates the pre-switch Fable reasoning.
See [Anthropic](/providers/anthropic#tool-calls-and-retained-thinking).

<a id="model-in-chat" />

## `/model` in chat

`/model <model>` changes the current session. Use `-s` for only this session, `-a` to also update the agent's default, or `-g` to also update the shared global default. The long forms are `--session`, `--agent`, and `--global`. Configured-default writes require owner or admin authority.

Without a scope flag, selections change only the current session. `agents.defaults.modelSelectionScope` can explicitly opt into `"agent"` or `"global"` scope. Owner/admin authority alone never broadens an unscoped selection. Without owner/admin authority, bare commands remain session-only and explicit `-a` or `-g` requests are rejected.

```text
/model
/model list
/model Opus
/model openai/gpt-5.4
/model openai/gpt-5.4 -s
/model openai/gpt-5.4 -a
/model openai/gpt-5.4 -g
/model default -s
/model default
/model status
```

- In text chat, `/model` shows the current selection. `/model list` (or `/models`) browses providers. `/models <provider>` lists model refs.
- Select with `/model <provider/model>` or `/model <alias>` (for example, `/model Opus` with the alias configured above). Numeric selections such as `/model 3` are not supported.
- On Discord, native `/model` and `/models` without arguments open an interactive picker. Choose a provider and model, then press **Submit**. Discord pickers follow the direct command behavior, including `modelSelectionScope`.
- On Telegram, `/model` offers a **Browse providers** button. `/model list` and `/models` open the provider menu directly. Tap a provider, then a model. Telegram callback selections always stay session-only.
- `/models add` is deprecated and returns a message instead of registering models from chat.
- **Current session:** `/model <model> -s` (or `--session`) changes only this session, regardless of `modelSelectionScope`. Neither configured default changes.
- **Agent default:** Owner/admin `/model <model> -a` (or `--agent`) selects the model for this session and requests an update for `agents.entries.<agent>.model`. It creates an explicit primary for that configured agent when needed and never falls through to the shared global default.
- **Global default:** Owner/admin `/model <model> -g` (or `--global`) changes this session and requests an update for the shared `agents.defaults.model` fallback. It does not overwrite other agents' explicit primaries or other sessions' model pins. New and existing unpinned sessions, and cron jobs that inherit this default, can use the changed model on their next run.
- Immutable configuration stays unchanged. Asynchronous write errors are logged without reverting the session selection. Explicit model and auth-profile pins survive `/new`, `/reset`, session rollover, compaction, and cooldown windows while valid.
- **Use the configured default:** `/model default -s` clears the current session model selection without writing configured defaults. A compatible auth-profile pin remains. An incompatible pin is cleared. Selecting the effective configured default by name also clears the session model pin, but agent/global scope still requests a write to that configured target. This does not restore an older configured default changed by a previous selection.
- **Follow compatible runtime selections:** Model-only changes preserve a session runtime pin when it supports the selected provider. Otherwise, the pin is cleared and the selected model follows its configured runtime automatically. An explicitly requested incompatible runtime is still rejected without changing either selection. Use `/model <provider/model> --runtime <runtime> -s` to switch runtimes, or `--runtime default` to follow configured routing. Explicit runtime rows and **Default** in the Control UI still select or reset the runtime.
- If the agent is idle, a model change applies to the next run immediately. If a run is already active, the switch is queued for the next clean retry point. It can be queued for a later point, if tool activity or reply output already started.
- A user-selected `/model` ref is strict for that session: if it becomes unreachable, the reply fails visibly instead of silently falling back through `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`. Configured defaults and cron job primaries still use fallback chains.
- `/model status` is the detailed view: auth candidates per provider, and (when configured) the provider endpoint `baseUrl` plus `api` mode.
- Model refs are parsed by splitting on the first `/`. Type `provider/model`. If the model ID itself contains `/` (OpenRouter-style), include the provider prefix, for example `/model openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2`. If you omit the provider, OpenClaw tries an alias match first. It then tries a unique configured-provider match for that exact unprefixed model id. It then tries the configured default provider, which is a deprecated fallback. If that provider no longer exposes the configured default model, OpenClaw uses the first configured provider and model instead. This avoids surfacing a stale removed-provider default.
- When inferring a provider, exact model ID case takes precedence over case-insensitive matches within the same configuration scope. A case-insensitive match is used only when it identifies one provider. Per-agent model entries take precedence over global entries and configured provider catalogs.
- Provider IDs are normalized to lowercase. Model IDs follow the provider's normalization rules. Use the spelling advertised by the plugin.
- Configured primary models also accept `provider/alias`. The alias resolves within that provider before inference, while an exact model ID configured for that provider keeps its literal identity. An optional auth-profile suffix such as `@work` stays separate from the model identity.

`openclaw models` with no subcommand is a shortcut for `models status`, which also surfaces OAuth expiry for auth-store profiles (warns within 24h by default). Full flags, JSON shapes, and auth-profile subcommands: [Models CLI reference](/cli/models).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scanning (OpenRouter free models)">
    `openclaw models scan` inspects OpenRouter's public free-model catalog and can probe candidates for tool and image support live. The catalog itself is public, so metadata-only scans (`--no-probe`) need no key. Live probing and `--set-default`/`--set-image` require an OpenRouter API key (auth profile or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). Without one they fail closed to metadata-only output.

    Results rank by: image support, then tool latency, then context size, then parameter count. In a TTY, probed results prompt an interactive fallback selection. Non-interactive mode needs `--yes` to accept defaults.

## Models registry (`models.json`)

### Hosted catalog updates

OpenClaw can refresh the model metadata shipped by installed provider plugins
without waiting for a new OpenClaw release. The Gateway makes one background
JSON `GET` at startup and then checks at most every six hours. The request sends
no prompts, credentials, model usage, or configuration payload beyond the
normal HTTP user agent and conditional cache headers.

The downloaded bundle is stored in the shared SQLite state database and becomes
visible after the next Gateway restart. Remote data can update or add models
only for providers declared by installed plugin manifests. It cannot supply API
base URLs or request headers, and a catalog older than the installed release's
build stamp is ignored.

The Gateway reports when a checked catalog needs a restart to become active,
including a bundle downloaded by another process. Repeated checks of the same
source and generation do not repeat the notice. Checking for an update does not
activate the downloaded rows or prices.

The hosted file is published from the public
[`openclaw/catalog`](https://github.com/openclaw/catalog) GitHub repository.
At publish time, it also hydrates model ids and metadata from models.dev for
providers whose owning plugin explicitly opts in with
[`modelCatalog.modelsDev`](/plugins/manifest/models#modelcatalog-reference). Each mapping
names the upstream provider once, rather than mapping individual models. There
is no central provider fallback. Manifest values remain authoritative, so
hydration only fills undefined metadata and never supplies transport settings
or prices. Costs still come from each provider's pricing policy. Only rows with
tool calling and text output are imported, and rows models.dev marks deprecated
or retired are skipped. Hydration errors fail publication and preserve the last
published artifact instead of publishing an incomplete replacement. This is a
publication-time contract: it adds no Gateway fetches or hot reload, and updated
metadata still becomes visible after a Gateway restart.
Its scheduled workflow checks OpenClaw's default-branch plugin manifests and
public pricing sources every four hours. Every catalog content change is
preserved as a public commit. Provider-owned policies select complete price
schedules, including context tiers, without mixing rates from different sources.
Declared native sources read the public Cerebras, Chutes, DeepInfra, OpenCode, and Venice
catalogs, so connected installations can receive advertised price changes without
a new OpenClaw release. When a valid native feed no longer supplies a model's
price, publication preserves the model metadata without an estimate. It does not
infer retirement or substitute another source's rate. Explicit user costs still
win. DeepInfra uses its agent projection for model metadata and its native
`/models/list` feed for prices, including numeric discounts. Qualified schedules
that cannot be represented as unconditional token costs stay unknown. Models
remain available. See [DeepInfra price estimates](/providers/deepinfra#price-estimates).

Run `openclaw models refresh` for an immediate metadata and pricing check, or
disable every hosted catalog request with `models.catalogRefresh.enabled:
false`. When disabled, pricing stays at bundled and explicitly configured
values. A self-hosted mirror can be selected with an HTTPS
`models.catalogRefresh.url` (or localhost HTTP for testing). See
[configuration reference](/gateway/config-runtime#models).

Custom providers configured under `models.providers` are written into `models.json` under the agent directory (default `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/models.json`). Provider-plugin catalogs are stored separately as generated plugin-owned catalog shards and load automatically. This file is merged with config by default. Set `models.mode: "replace"` to use only your configured providers.

In the default `merge` mode, configured model rows are combined with eligible
provider discovery. They supply metadata and request overrides for matching
models; they do not limit discovery to the saved IDs. Older provider model
arrays can remain in your configuration without hiding newly advertised models.
Use `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` or a per-agent policy to restrict model
selection, and `models.mode: "replace"` to keep a fully static configured catalog.

Generated plugin catalogs supply model inventory, not request credentials. Their
cached API keys, authentication modes, and request headers do not authorize model
requests. Use a current auth profile or authored request configuration instead.
Without a current configuration snapshot, the session SDK preserves authored
`models.json` keys and headers while merging generated metadata below authored rows.
With a current snapshot, the provider's current declaration owns request settings;
keys and headers left only in an older file do not regain authority.

Prepared catalogs compose static, generated, authored-file, and current configured
rows before resolving models. Explicit model routes win over captured routes, which
win over provider defaults. In replace mode, only current declarations enter the
catalog; manifest inventory and runtime fallback rows cannot add other models.

Provider aliases in `models.providers.*.models` resolve once before discovery.
If an alias and its exact destination are both configured, the destination row
owns the model fields; omitted fields are not copied from the alias row.
Catalog IDs from `models.json` and plugin discovery stay literal during refresh,
apart from built-in corrections for retired Google and Together model names.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="models.json publication merge precedence">
    The file publication step uses these rules for matching provider IDs. They do
    not override current-configuration request authority in a prepared runtime:

    - A non-empty `baseUrl` already present in the agent `models.json` wins.
    - A non-empty `apiKey` in `models.json` wins only when that provider is not SecretRef-managed in the current config/auth-profile context.
    - SecretRef-managed `apiKey` values refresh from source markers instead of persisting resolved secrets: the env variable name for env refs, `secretref-managed` for file/exec/store refs.
    - SecretRef-managed header values refresh the same way, using `secretref-env:ENV_VAR_NAME` for env refs.
    - Empty or missing `apiKey`/`baseUrl` in `models.json` fall back to config `models.providers`.
    - Configured and discovered model lists are combined in merge mode. For matching rows, an explicit `input` wins. When the source row omits `input`, plugin discovery can fill that capability metadata.
    - Other provider fields refresh from config and normalized catalog data.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Marker persistence is source-authoritative. OpenClaw writes markers from the active source config snapshot (pre-resolution), not from resolved runtime secret values. It does this whenever it regenerates `models.json`, including command-driven paths like `openclaw agent`.

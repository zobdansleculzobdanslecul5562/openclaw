OpenClaw handles failures in two stages:

1. **Auth-profile rotation** within the current provider.
2. **Model fallback** to the next model in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.

Before rotating profiles or changing models, the runner attempts bounded
same-model recovery for temporary rate limits and provider failures. It continues
the existing transcript, preserving partial output and completed work. The agent
is instructed to inspect interrupted actions before deciding whether to repeat
them. A retry status shows the wait and attempt count. Cancellation remains
available. No additional configuration is required.

Thinking-level recovery applies only when the provider identifies a reasoning or
thinking parameter. Model/account restrictions and unrelated unsupported options
keep their original failure classification and follow the configured fallback
policy. OpenClaw does not retry them with thinking disabled.

## Runtime flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Resolve session state">
    Resolve the active session model and auth-profile preference.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build candidate chain">
    Build the model candidate chain from the current model selection and the fallback policy for that selection source. Configured defaults, cron job primaries, and auto-selected fallback models can use configured fallbacks. Explicit user session selections are strict.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try the current provider">
    Try the current provider with auth-profile rotation/cooldown rules. Runs apply bounded recovery to eligible transient failures before rotating profiles or advancing model fallback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advance on failover-worthy errors">
    If that provider is exhausted with a failover-worthy error, move to the next model candidate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use fallback for the current turn">
    Run the winning fallback candidate without changing the session's selected provider/model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Report failure if exhausted">
    If every candidate fails, surface the terminal failure. Thrown exhaustion summaries include structured per-attempt details and the soonest cooldown expiry when one is known.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Fallback execution is turn-local. The reply runner persists only fallback notice state so `/status` and transition notices can distinguish the selected model from the model that answered. It does not persist the fallback as the next turn's model selection.

Sessions placed on an OpenClaw cloud worker keep the OpenClaw runtime when
automatic model selection advances to a fallback. The configured provider,
model, and auth-profile fallback rules still apply. Explicit session or
configured runtime choices remain strict: an incompatible runtime reports a
placement error and requires a compatible destination before retrying.

When configured fallback stops because the agent run reaches a final timeout or
the idle-timeout cost-runaway breaker returns a terminal error, the
`model-fallback/decision` logger records `model_fallback_chain_stopped` with
reason `agent_run_terminal_timeout` or `idle_timeout_circuit_breaker`. These are
terminal stops, not provider failures or requests to try another model. The
existing run deadline and cost limits still apply.

## Automatic cyber-policy escalation

The embedded OpenClaw runtime retries one replay-safe OpenAI cyber-policy refusal on Daybreak
Blue. This includes normal embedded turns using the ChatGPT-authenticated OpenAI Responses
transport, not only Codex plugin sessions. That transport projects OpenAI's structured cyber-policy
error into the refusal metadata used by this policy, from every terminal path it can arrive on: a
non-OK HTTP body, a streamed `error` event, and a `response.failed` event. Generic refusal text
without a structured cyber category remains terminal.

This policy route is turn-local: it does not change the selected session model and it does not send
ordinary provider failures to Daybreak. Codex-backed sessions keep their separate plugin-owned
policy described in [Codex harness runtime behavior](/plugins/codex-harness/runtime-behavior#automatic-daybreak-escalation).

The default target is `openai/gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`. The retry runs only when all of these are
true:

- the selected embedded attempt reports `provider_refusal` with provider `openai` and category
  `cyber`;
- the attempt's replay metadata proves that no tool or delivery side effect would be repeated;
- the target differs from the model that was refused;
- the selection is not strict; and
- the feature is enabled.

A strict selection stays strict. A locked model selection reaches the runner as an explicit empty
fallback list, and this policy honors that the same way ordinary fallback does: the refusal remains
terminal until the operator unlocks the selection.

If the Daybreak attempt fails without committing work, OpenClaw preserves the original provider
refusal instead of trying unrelated configured fallbacks. If the retry already executed a tool or
delivered output before failing, its own result is kept instead, because its replay verdict,
delivery evidence, and terminal receipt describe what actually ran. If the retry throws anything
other than an ordinary failover-class error, that exception propagates unchanged: a recorded
terminal stop prohibits replay, and an unclassified throw is how the fallback runner reports an
attempt that already committed work. An authorization failure cools down that target for the
current session before another cyber refusal probes it again.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      embeddedAgent: {
        cyberFailover: {
          mode: "auto", // or "off"
          model: "openai/gpt-daybreak-blue-latest",
          cooloffMs: 600000,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

General model fallback ordering is unchanged. A non-cyber refusal, a Codex/native-harness result,
or any replay-unsafe attempt remains terminal under the existing refusal policy.

## Selection source policy

The selection source controls whether the fallback chain is allowed:

- **Configured default**: `agents.defaults.model.primary` uses `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.
- **Native agent primary**: `agents.entries.*.model` is strict unless that agent's model object includes its own `fallbacks`. Use `fallbacks: []` to make the strict behavior explicit, or a non-empty list to opt that agent into model fallback.
- **ACP agent primary**: for `runtime.type: "acp"`, the agent primary selects its external harness model. Native OpenClaw calls inherit the primary and fallbacks from `agents.defaults.model`; an explicit agent `model.fallbacks` replaces the native fallback list, including `[]` to disable it. Explicit native session and subagent selections retain their normal precedence and strictness. This does not add fallback to commands such as `/btw` that run only their selected model.
- **Runtime fallback**: the fallback candidate applies only to the current turn. The next turn starts from the selected primary again. OpenClaw still recognizes `modelOverrideSource: "auto"` entries stored by v2026.4.26 through v2026.6.0. It probes their configured origin every 5 minutes, and clears them once the origin recovers. Automatic clearing shipped in v2026.6.1. `/new`, `/reset`, and `sessions.reset` also clear those entries.
- **User session override**: selecting a specific model with `/model`, the model picker, `session_status(model=...)`, or `sessions.patch` writes `modelOverrideSource: "user"`. This is an exact session selection. If the selected provider/model fails before producing a reply, OpenClaw reports the failure instead of answering from an unrelated configured fallback.
- **Explicit configured default**: choosing **Default** through the same surfaces writes `modelOverrideSource: "default"` without storing a provider/model override. This prevents a child session from inheriting a parent model pin while preserving the configured default's normal fallback policy.
- **Legacy session override**: session entries written before v2026.4.26 may have `modelOverride` without `modelOverrideSource`. OpenClaw treats those as user overrides so an explicit old selection is not silently converted into fallback behavior.
- **Cron payload model**: a cron job `payload.model` / `--model` is a job primary, not a user session override. It uses configured fallbacks unless the job provides `payload.fallbacks`. `payload.fallbacks: []` makes the cron run strict.

An agent can override only its fallback chain with `model: { fallbacks: [...] }`
and keep inheriting the shared primary. Setting `fallbacks: []` explicitly disables
fallbacks without pinning that primary. In **Settings → Agents → Overview**, editing
fallback chips preserves primary inheritance. Removing every chip saves an empty
chain instead of restoring the shared fallbacks.

## Auth storage (keys + OAuth)

OpenClaw uses **auth profiles** for both API keys and OAuth tokens.

- Secrets and runtime auth-routing state live in `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite`.
- Config `auth.profiles` / `auth.order` are **metadata + routing only** (no secrets).
- Legacy `credentials/oauth.json`, `auth-profiles.json`, `auth-state.json`, and
  per-agent `auth.json` files are imported only by `openclaw doctor --fix`.
  Runtime fails closed for the affected agent until credential-bearing legacy
  files are migrated. It never silently imports or falls back to them.

More detail: [OAuth](/concepts/oauth)

Credential types:

- `type: "api_key"` → `{ provider, key }`
- `type: "oauth"` → `{ provider, access, refresh, expires, email? }` (+ `projectId`/`enterpriseUrl` for some providers)
- `type: "token"` → static bearer-style token, optionally expiring. OpenClaw does not refresh it (used for `aws-sdk` and other credential-chain auth modes)

## Profile IDs

OAuth logins create distinct profiles so multiple accounts can coexist.

- Default: `provider:default` when no email is available.
- OAuth with email: `provider:<email>` (for example `openai:user@example.com`).

Profiles live in the per-agent `openclaw-agent.sqlite` auth profile store.

## Rotation order

When a provider has multiple profiles, OpenClaw chooses an order like this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stored order override">
    The per-agent order set with `openclaw models auth order set --provider <id> <profileIds...>`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explicit config">
    `auth.order[provider]` (if set).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configured profiles">
    `auth.profiles` filtered by provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stored profiles">
    Per-agent SQLite auth profile entries for the provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If no explicit order is configured, OpenClaw uses a round-robin order:

- **Primary key:** profile type (**OAuth, then static token, then API key**).
- **Secondary key for OAuth:** profiles with a currently usable access token before
  profiles whose access token is expired. Expired OAuth profiles stay eligible so
  the runtime can refresh them when no usable peer is available.
- **Next key:** `usageStats.lastUsed` (oldest first, within each type/state tier).
- **Cooldown/disabled profiles** are moved to the end, ordered by soonest expiry.

### Session stickiness (cache-friendly)

Clearing or rotating an auth pin affects only the selected agent’s session, including custom session stores and the reserved `global` and `unknown` session keys.

OpenClaw **pins the automatically chosen auth profile per session** to keep provider caches warm. It does **not** rotate on every request. An automatic pin may rotate or clear when:

- the session is reset (`/new` / `/reset`)
- the profile is in cooldown/disabled

Context compaction does not change the selected auth profile. A healthy profile remains pinned
across compaction; auth failures and unavailable profiles still use the normal fallback order.

Manual selection via `/model …@<profileId> -s` sets a **user override**. A valid user pin survives `/new`, `/reset`, session rollover, compaction, and cooldown windows. It remains the first preference when eligible. While that exact profile is in cooldown or disabled, OpenClaw tries the next eligible same-provider profile without replacing the stored pin. OpenClaw clears the pin when the profile disappears, no longer matches the selected provider, or the user selects another explicit profile. `/model default -s` clears the model override while retaining a compatible auth pin and clearing an incompatible one.

<Note>
Auto-pinned and user-pinned auth profiles are both retry preferences. OpenClaw tries the selected profile first while it is eligible. It may then rotate to another same-provider profile on auth failures, rate limits, billing limits, or timeouts. A user pin stays persisted during that temporary rotation. New runs prefer it again after its cooldown expires, without changing the selected model or runtime. This auth rotation does not loosen model selection: an explicit user provider/model selection remains strict and reports failure after its same-provider auth profiles are exhausted.
</Note>

### OpenAI Codex subscription plus API-key backup

For OpenAI agent models, auth and runtime are separate. `openai/gpt-*` stays on the Codex harness while auth can rotate between a Codex subscription profile and an OpenAI API-key backup.

Use `auth.order.openai` for the user-facing order:

```json5
{
  auth: {
    order: {
      openai: ["openai:user@example.com", "openai:api-key-backup"],
    },
  },
}
```

Use `openai:*` for both ChatGPT/Codex OAuth profiles and OpenAI API-key profiles. When the subscription hits a Codex usage limit, OpenClaw records the exact reset time when Codex provides one. It tries the next ordered auth profile, and keeps the run inside the Codex harness. Once the reset time passes, the subscription profile is eligible again and the next automatic selection can return to it.

Use a user-pinned profile to make one account/key the durable first preference for that session. If it becomes unavailable, OpenClaw temporarily rotates through the remaining eligible `auth.order.openai` profiles and returns to the pinned profile after recovery.

## Cooldowns

When a profile fails due to auth or rate-limit errors, OpenClaw marks it in cooldown and moves to the next profile. A timeout that looks like rate limiting counts as such a failure.

CLI-backed runtimes settle profile health only after their resume, fork, and fresh-session recovery attempts finish. A terminal credential failure cools down the exact selected profile before model fallback. A successful run clears stale failure state. Transcript, format, context, pre-provider timeout, and ambient CLI failures without a selected profile do not change shared profile health.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What lands in the rate-limit / timeout bucket">
    That rate-limit bucket is broader than plain `429`: it also includes provider messages such as `Too many concurrent requests`, `ThrottlingException`, `concurrency limit reached`, `workers_ai ... quota limit exceeded`, `throttled`, `resource exhausted`, and periodic usage-window limits such as `weekly limit reached` or `monthly limit exhausted`.

    Format/invalid-request errors are usually terminal because retrying the same payload would fail the same way, so OpenClaw surfaces them instead of rotating auth profiles. Known retry-repair paths can opt in explicitly: for example Cloud Code Assist tool call ID validation failures are sanitized and retried once through the `allowFormatRetry` policy.

    OpenAI-compatible **provider-completed** stop/finish reasons such as `Unhandled stop reason: error`, `stop reason: error`, `reason: error`, and `Provider finish_reason: error` are classified as **`server_error`** (HTTP-like status 500), not timeout. They remain failover-worthy for model or auth-profile rotation, but diagnostics keep the provider finish-reason text instead of rewriting the user copy to "LLM request timed out." Transport-shaped finish reasons such as `Provider finish_reason: abort`, `network_error`, and `malformed_response` stay in the timeout/failover bucket (status 408).

    HTTP status mapping uses **`server_error`** for otherwise-unclassified non-timing `5xx` failures, including `502` and `503`. HTTP `529` retains **`overloaded`**. The timing statuses retain **`timeout`**: request timeout `408`, gateway timeouts `504`, `522`, and `524`, and nginx client-abort `499`. More-specific provider errors and context classifications keep their existing precedence.

    Generic server text can also land in that timeout bucket when the source matches a known transient pattern. For example, the bare model runtime stream-wrapper message `An unknown error occurred` is treated as failover-worthy for every provider. The shared model runtime emits it when provider streams end with `stopReason: "aborted"` or `stopReason: "error"` without specific details. JSON `api_error` payloads with transient server text such as `internal server error`, `unknown error, 520`, `upstream error`, or `backend error` are also treated as failover-worthy timeouts.

    OpenRouter-specific generic upstream text such as bare `Provider returned error` is treated as timeout only when the provider context is actually OpenRouter. Generic internal fallback text such as `LLM request failed with an unknown error.` stays conservative and does not trigger failover by itself.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SDK retry-after caps">
    Some provider SDKs may otherwise sleep for a long `Retry-After` window before returning control to OpenClaw. For Stainless-based SDKs such as Anthropic and OpenAI, OpenClaw caps SDK-internal `retry-after-ms` and `retry-after` waits at 60 seconds by default. It surfaces longer retryable responses immediately, so this failover path can run. Tune or disable the cap with `OPENCLAW_SDK_RETRY_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`. See [Retry behavior](/concepts/retry).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Model-scoped cooldowns">
    Rate-limit cooldowns can also be model-scoped:

    - OpenClaw records `cooldownModel` for rate-limit failures when the failing model id is known.
    - A sibling model on the same provider can still be tried when the cooldown is scoped to a different model.
    - Billing/disabled windows still block the whole profile across models.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Regular (non-billing, non-auth-permanent) cooldowns scale with the profile's recent error count:

- 1st failure: 30 seconds
- 2nd failure: 1 minute
- 3rd+ failure: 5 minutes (cap)

Counters reset once the profile's built-in failure window has passed.

State is stored in the per-agent SQLite auth state under `usageStats`:

```json
{
  "usageStats": {
    "provider:profile": {
      "lastUsed": 1736160000000,
      "cooldownUntil": 1736160600000,
      "errorCount": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Auth failure skip cache

By default, every new turn keeps the existing fallback retry behavior. OpenClaw retries each configured fallback candidate again. This includes non-primary candidates that recently failed with `auth` or `auth_permanent`.

Opt in to suppress repeat auth failures with:

```bash
OPENCLAW_FALLBACK_SKIP_TTL_MS=60000
```

When enabled, OpenClaw records an in-memory, session-scoped skip marker for a non-primary fallback candidate after an auth-class failure. The key includes the session, provider, model, and selected automatic or explicit profile ID. Switching profiles does not inherit another profile's failure marker. Primary candidates are never skipped, so an explicit user model selection still surfaces the real auth error. The cache is process-local and clears on Gateway restart.

The value is a TTL in milliseconds. `0` or unset disables the cache. Positive values are clamped between 1 second and 10 minutes.

## Billing disables

Billing/credit failures (for example "insufficient credits" / "credit balance too low") are treated as failover-worthy. OpenClaw marks the credential as **disabled** for ten minutes initially and rotates to the next eligible profile/provider.

Configured inline API keys cannot retry during an active disable window. After the window expires, they become eligible again. Another billing failure starts a new ten-minute window. Stored auth profiles can also recover through bounded primary-provider probes during a disable window. Recharging does not itself clear persisted state, and upgrading leaves an already-active window at its existing deadline.

<Note>
Not every billing-shaped response is `402`, and not every HTTP `402` lands here. OpenClaw keeps explicit billing text in the billing bucket, even when a provider returns `401` or `403` instead. Provider-specific matchers stay scoped to the provider that owns them, for example OpenRouter `403 Key limit exceeded`.

Meanwhile temporary `402` usage-window and organization/workspace spend-limit errors are classified as `rate_limit` when the message looks retryable (for example `weekly usage limit exhausted`, `daily limit reached, resets tomorrow`, or `organization spending limit exceeded`). Those stay on the short cooldown/failover path instead of the long billing-disable path.
</Note>

High-confidence permanent-auth failures (revoked/deactivated keys, deactivated workspaces) use the same ten-minute initial disable window because some providers surface auth-looking payloads transiently during incidents.

State is stored in the per-agent SQLite auth state:

```json
{
  "usageStats": {
    "provider:profile": {
      "disabledUntil": 1736178000000,
      "disabledReason": "billing"
    }
  }
}
```

Overloaded and rate-limit errors allow one same-provider auth-profile rotation by default before advancing to the next configured model fallback. The active runtime first uses its eligible same-model recovery budget. Auth-profile rotation and model fallback still require evidence that replaying the original attempt is safe.

## Model fallback

If all profiles for a provider fail, OpenClaw moves to the next model in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` when the failure matches one of the failover reasons listed below. This includes `model_not_found` for HTTP 404 responses. It does not include a 404 whose response body identifies a more specific condition, such as context overflow, session expiry, billing, authentication, or request format. Provider errors that do not expose enough detail are still labeled precisely in fallback state. `empty_response` means the provider returned no usable message or status. `no_error_details` means the provider explicitly returned `Unknown error (no error details in response)`. `unclassified` means OpenClaw preserved the raw preview but no classifier matched it yet.

Provider-busy signals such as `ModelNotReadyException` land in the overloaded bucket and follow the same one-rotation-then-fallback policy as rate limits.

The failover controller owns OpenClaw's transient recovery budget. Rate limits receive up to **10 total attempts** before auth-profile rotation or model fallback. Jittered exponential waits cap at 30 seconds, while provider `retry-after` and `retry-after-ms` hints remain minimum waits even beyond that cap. Other transient failures retain eight retries and a 90-second window for consecutive outages. A completed successful model response clears that window without resetting the total retry count; partial output and tool activity alone do not. Once that budget or window is exhausted, recovery proceeds to eligible auth-profile rotation, configured model fallback, or a visible error. Continuations preserve the transcript instead of replaying the original user request. Recovery and any fallback winner remain turn-local.

The embedded runtime's existing session setting `retry.provider.maxRetries` overrides its recovery retry budget. `0` disables retries, and rate limits remain capped at 10 total attempts. It is not an `openclaw.json` key and does not change a native harness's internal request retries. Native harnesses may finish their own request retries before OpenClaw starts continuation recovery. The reply runner does not add another whole-turn replay loop. See [Retry policy](/concepts/retry) for pacing and exclusions.

While waiting, the Control UI shows one transient **Retrying… n/10** indicator for rate limits. Retried failures do not become persisted assistant messages. Terminal failure retains one error. History hides recovered empty or reasoning-only errors without rewriting stored transcripts.

Visible failure messages preserve the provider's HTTP status independently of retry classification. A provider HTTP 500 remains a server error in the final reply, and recovery classifies it as `server_error` rather than grouping it with timeout-shaped failures. Raw provider response details stay out of that reply.

Gateway transcript-validation failures are local format errors. They do not rotate or cool down healthy credentials, and both assistant errors and thrown run failures identify the rejected session transcript entry with recovery guidance. Genuine provider-session expiry keeps its existing credential-health behavior.

Provider overloads and HTTP 5xx failures use transient recovery guidance. A message saying only that a model is "not available" does not establish that it was retired or that your configuration needs to change. Configuration guidance requires a missing-model response or an explicit account/model restriction. Codex turn errors retain their overload and HTTP-status information even after Codex stops retrying the turn.

When a run starts from the configured default primary, a cron job primary, an agent primary with explicit fallbacks, or an auto-selected fallback override, OpenClaw can walk the matching configured fallback chain. Agent primaries without explicit fallbacks are strict. Explicit user selections are also strict: `/model ollama/qwen3.5:27b`, the model picker, `sessions.patch`, and one-off CLI provider/model overrides. If that provider or model is unreachable, or fails before producing a reply, OpenClaw reports the failure instead of answering from an unrelated fallback.

### Candidate chain rules

OpenClaw builds the candidate list from the currently requested `provider/model` plus configured fallbacks.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rules">
    - The requested model is always first.
    - Explicit configured fallbacks are deduplicated but not filtered by the model allowlist. They are treated as explicit operator intent.
    - If the current run is already on a configured fallback in the same provider family, OpenClaw keeps using the full configured chain.
    - When no explicit fallback override is supplied, configured fallbacks are tried before the configured primary even if the requested model uses a different provider.
    - When no explicit fallback override is supplied to the fallback runner, the configured primary is appended at the end. The chain can then settle back onto the normal default once earlier candidates are exhausted.
    - When a caller supplies `fallbacksOverride`, the runner uses exactly the requested model plus that override list. An empty list disables model fallback and prevents the configured primary from being appended as a hidden retry target.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Which errors advance fallback

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Continues on">
    - auth failures
    - rate limits and cooldown exhaustion
    - overloaded/provider-busy errors
    - timeout-shaped failover errors
    - billing disables
    - `model_not_found`, including eligible HTTP 404 responses
    - `LiveSessionModelSwitchError` for a stale current or earlier candidate. Later configured targets redirect directly, while targets outside the chain return to the bounded session-model retry owner
    - a provider request-size ceiling reaching the fallback boundary, which happens when a transport-owning plugin harness bypasses embedded recovery. The ceiling belongs to the refusing provider's quota rather than to any model's context window, so a differently provisioned candidate may still admit the request
    - other unrecognized errors when there are still remaining candidates

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Does not continue on">
    - explicit aborts that are not timeout/failover-shaped
    - context overflow errors that should stay inside compaction/retry logic (for example `request_too_large`, `input token count exceeds the maximum number of input tokens`, `input exceeds the maximum number of tokens`, `input too long for the model`, or `ollama error: context length exceeded`)
    - context overflow inside an embedded run that has already been declared terminal, including a provider request-size ceiling (for example Groq's `413 ... on tokens per minute (TPM): Limit 8000, Requested 8098`), which the runner stops on rather than compacting
    - a final unknown error when there are no candidates left
    - final provider refusals. Eligible Anthropic direct API-key requests handle refusal fallback within the provider request instead (see [Anthropic](/providers/anthropic#safety-refusal-fallback-claude-opus-5-and-fable-5))

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

A final provider refusal ends the current turn. OpenClaw surfaces it without automatic recovery turns, compaction retries, or switching to an unrelated model. Except for a misalignment precaution, a queued or later user message still starts its own turn.

### Misalignment precautions

An OpenAI `misalignment_policy_violation` stops further work in the affected
conversation. It means the agent's interpretation of the task needs review; it
does not establish that the user violated a policy. OpenClaw preserves available
provider findings and holds queued messages instead of retrying the conversation.
Already-accepted results can still finish recording.

In the Control UI, choose **Review findings**. When a supported Codex or ChatGPT
Responses runtime supplies a continuation, the dialog shows its exact message
before offering **Acknowledge findings and continue**. Confirmation applies only
to the displayed session and findings. It preserves the runtime, model, sandbox,
and approval settings; a changed review requires another decision. The precaution
clears only after the provider accepts the continuation. Previously queued
messages remain held for individual review and retry.

Ordinary API-key Responses and incognito conversations do not offer continuation.
Missing or incomplete findings also cannot authorize one. A stopped conversation
does not undo actions already completed. See [OpenAI's misalignment monitoring
guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/safety-checks/misalignment-monitoring).

### Cooldown skip vs probe behavior

When every auth profile for a provider is already in cooldown, OpenClaw does not automatically skip that provider forever. It makes a per-candidate decision:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Per-candidate decisions">
    - Persistent auth failures skip the whole provider immediately.
    - Billing disables usually skip, but the primary candidate can still be probed on a throttle so recovery is possible without restarting.
    - The primary candidate may be probed near cooldown expiry, with a per-provider throttle.
    - Same-provider fallback siblings can be attempted despite cooldown when the failure looks transient (`rate_limit`, `overloaded`, or unknown). This is especially relevant when a rate limit is model-scoped and a sibling model may still recover immediately.
    - Transient cooldown probes are limited to one per provider per fallback run so a single provider does not stall cross-provider fallback.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Session overrides and live model switching

Session model changes are shared state. The active runner, `/model` command, compaction/session updates, and live-session reconciliation all read or write parts of the same session entry. Fallback execution does not write model-selection fields, so it cannot replace a newer manual selection while retrying.

Live model switching follows these rules:

- Only explicit user-driven model changes mark a pending live switch. That includes `/model`, `session_status(model=...)`, and `sessions.patch`.
- System-driven model changes such as fallback rotation, heartbeat overrides, or compaction never mark a pending live switch on their own.
- User-driven model overrides are treated as exact selections for fallback policy. An unreachable selected provider therefore surfaces as a failure, instead of being masked by `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.
- Runtime fallback candidates remain turn-local. The next turn starts from the current selected model, including a manual selection that arrived during the previous run.
- Previously stored auto fallback overrides remain supported: OpenClaw periodically probes their configured origin and clears the override when it recovers. `/new`, `/reset`, and `sessions.reset` clear auto-sourced overrides immediately.
- Outside group and channel conversations, user replies announce fallback transitions and fallback-cleared recovery once per state change. Repeated turns with the same selected/active pair do not repeat the notice. Group and channel conversations retain the same fallback state and lifecycle events without posting it.
- `/status` shows the selected model and, when fallback state differs, the active fallback model and reason.
- Live-session reconciliation prefers persisted session overrides over stale runtime model fields.
- If a live-switch error points at a later candidate in the active fallback chain, OpenClaw jumps directly to that selected model. It does not walk unrelated candidates first.
- A live switch can select a model outside the active fallback chain. OpenClaw then returns the original switch to the agent, reply, or isolated-cron retry owner. The selected model can complete the same turn.

The active run carries its chosen candidate directly. Live reconciliation changes that candidate only for an explicit pending user switch, so no temporary fallback override or rollback is needed.

When a recorded fallback notice belongs to a different selected model, status and session lists skip its optional transcript lookup. That stale-notice path no longer surfaces transcript-only errors or starts projection reconciliation. Matching notices use a read-only transcript lookup that neither creates storage nor starts projection reconciliation. If optional storage or projections are unavailable, the lookup omits transcript-derived details. Unexpected read errors still propagate.

## User-visible fallback notices

Outside group and channel conversations, OpenClaw sends a status notice in the same reply surface when a session moves onto an auto-selected fallback:

```text
↪️ Model Fallback: <fallback> (selected <primary>; <reason>)
```

When a later probe succeeds and the session returns to the selected primary, OpenClaw sends:

```text
↪️ Model Fallback cleared: <primary> (was <fallback>)
```

These notices are operational messages, not assistant content. They deliver once per state change outside group and channel conversations, including side-effect-only turns when feasible, but repeated turn-local fallback transitions do not repeat them. Group and channel conversations suppress the visible notices while retaining the same fallback state and lifecycle events. Delivery bypasses normal source-reply suppression, does not consume the first assistant reply slot for threaded channels, and is excluded from text-to-speech.

Persisted notice state prevents repeated notices when consecutive turns use the same selected/active pair, while model selection itself remains unchanged.

When a fallback answers, the Control UI shows the successful answer once and removes empty failed-attempt placeholders from that same run. The raw transcript retains the failed attempts for troubleshooting. Failed turns and attempts that produced partial visible output remain visible.

## Observability and failure summaries

`runWithModelFallback(...)` records per-attempt details that feed logs and user-facing cooldown messaging:

- provider/model attempted
- reason (`rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `billing`, `auth`, `model_not_found`, and similar failover reasons)
- optional status/code
- human-readable error summary

Structured `model_fallback_decision` logs also include flat `fallbackStep*` fields when a candidate fails, is skipped, or a later fallback succeeds. These fields make the attempted transition explicit: `fallbackStepFromModel`, `fallbackStepToModel`, `fallbackStepFromFailureReason`, `fallbackStepFromFailureDetail`, and `fallbackStepFinalOutcome`. Log and diagnostic exporters can reconstruct the primary failure even when the terminal fallback also fails.

For a missing-model fallback, look for a `model_fallback_decision` event whose `reason` or `fallbackStepFromFailureReason` is `model_not_found`.

Exhaustion summaries preserve the structured attempt records. The fallback runner can return a classified exhausted result or throw a `FailoverError`. The outer reply runner can use those details to build a more specific message, such as "all models are temporarily rate-limited". It can include the soonest cooldown expiry when one is known.

That cooldown summary is model-aware:

- unrelated model-scoped rate limits are ignored for the attempted provider/model chain
- if the remaining block is a matching model-scoped rate limit, OpenClaw reports the last matching expiry that still blocks that model

OpenClaw exposes four user-facing update channels:

- stable: the promoted regular release on npm `latest`
- extended-stable: the trailing completed month's `.33+` maintenance line on
  npm `extended-stable`
- beta: prerelease tags on npm `beta`
- dev: the moving head of `main`

Extended-stable ships the trailing month's Gateway, official npm plugins, and
Docker images without moving regular `latest` or `main` selectors.

Tideclaw alpha builds are a separate internal prerelease track (npm dist-tag `alpha`), covered under [NPM workflow inputs](#npm-workflow-inputs) and [Release test boxes](#release-test-boxes).

## Version naming

- Monthly Gateway extended-stable release version: `YYYY.M.PATCH`, with `PATCH >= 33`, git tag `vYYYY.M.PATCH`
- Daily/regular final release version: `YYYY.M.PATCH`, with `PATCH < 33`, git tag `vYYYY.M.PATCH`
- Regular fallback correction release version: `YYYY.M.PATCH-N`, git tag `vYYYY.M.PATCH-N`
- Beta prerelease version: `YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N`, git tag `vYYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N`
- Alpha prerelease version: `YYYY.M.PATCH-alpha.N`, git tag `vYYYY.M.PATCH-alpha.N`
- Never zero-pad month or patch
- `PATCH` is a sequential monthly release-train number, not a calendar day. Regular final and beta releases advance the current train; alpha-only tags never consume or advance the beta/regular patch number, so ignore legacy alpha-only tags with higher patch numbers when selecting a beta or regular train.
- Alpha/nightly builds use the next unreleased patch train and increment only `alpha.N` for repeated builds. Once that patch has a beta, new alpha builds move to the following patch.
- npm versions are immutable: never delete, republish, or reuse a published tag. Cut the next prerelease number or the next monthly patch instead.
- `latest` continues to follow the current regular/daily npm line. For core and every published official plugin, `beta` must always resolve to a version greater than or equal to `latest` under semver ordering; a same-train prerelease is older than its final release.
- `extended-stable` means the supported trailing-month Gateway distribution, beginning at patch `33`; patch `34` and later are maintenance releases on that monthly line
- Regular final and regular correction releases publish to npm `beta` by default; release operators can target `latest` explicitly, or promote a vetted beta build later
- Gateway extended-stable publishes core, every npm-publishable official plugin,
  and its Docker images at one exact version; see the dedicated workflow below.
- Regular final releases publish the npm package first and finalize the GitHub release after npm and Docker verification. macOS, signed Windows Hub installers, and the signed standalone Android APK publish independently in parallel or afterward; app readiness never delays npm or GitHub publication. Verify each native release separately before announcing all platforms complete. Beta releases normally validate and publish the npm/package path first, with native app build/sign/notarize/promote reserved for regular final unless explicitly requested.

## Release cadence

- Releases move beta-first; stable follows only after the latest beta is validated. Publishing or promoting to `latest` requires immediate beta-floor repair through the release ledger; a newer beta remains unchanged.
- Maintainers normally cut releases from a `release/YYYY.M.PATCH` branch created from current `main`, so release validation and fixes do not block new development on `main`
- If a beta tag has been pushed or published and needs a fix, maintainers cut the next `-beta.N` tag instead of deleting or recreating the old one
- Detailed release procedure, approvals, credentials, and recovery notes are maintainer-only

## Monthly Gateway extended-stable publication

For completed month `YYYY.M`, create `extended-stable/YYYY.M.33` and publish
`.33+` from that branch. Tag, branch, checkout, package version, preflight, and
validation must identify one commit. Before `.33`, protected `main` must contain
a later month's final version below patch `33`; later maintenance patches remain
eligible.

### Prepare and stabilize the candidate

Audit the unaudited mainline range, reconcile private security work, approve a
bounded backport set, and land one coordinated PR. Do not push the canonical
branch directly.

On the canonical branch, set `YYYY.M.P`, run `pnpm release:prep`, and require
that version in every publishable official plugin. From the approved ledger,
generate and commit a complete `## YYYY.M.P` section with `### Highlights`,
`### Changes`, and `### Fixes`, citing original merged `main` PRs for equivalent
backports. Preflight rejects a missing or empty section.

Carry the full current-main Docker release-channel unit: workflow, promoter,
policy, shared classifier, tests, and workflow validation. GitHub loads tag
workflows from the tagged commit; an incomplete copy can fail after building or
move regular aliases. Run focused checks.

Freeze the full branch-tip SHA and record the exact trusted-main Tooling SHA.
Before tagging, run Full Release Validation through its immutable workflow
transport; it also prepares and qualifies the exact npm and Docker bytes.
`pnpm ci:full-release` runs `scripts/full-release-validation-at-sha.mjs`; this
page uses the `pnpm` form throughout.

```bash
VALIDATION_SHA="<exact-candidate-sha>"
TOOLING_SHA="<recorded-full-main-ancestor-sha>"
CONTEXT_REF="extended-stable/YYYY.M.33"
pnpm ci:full-release \
  --sha "$VALIDATION_SHA" \
  --target-ref "$CONTEXT_REF" \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA" \
  -f release_profile=stable \
  -f run_release_soak=true \
  -f fail_fast=false \
  -f rerun_group=all \
  -f reuse_evidence=false \
  -f dispatch_release_evidence=false
```

The helper dispatches from an immutable `release-ci/*` ref at the Tooling SHA,
passes the Validation SHA as `ref` and `expected_sha`, and records the canonical
branch as `target_context_ref`. GitHub workflow dispatch `--ref` must name a
branch or tag; it cannot be a raw SHA. Save the successful run ID and
`run_attempt`. When its manifest contains `publicationArtifacts.npmPreflight`,
use that same Full Release Validation run and attempt for both npm preflight and
full validation publication evidence.

Extended-stable also requires a separate npm preflight from trusted `main`:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-npm-release.yml \
  --repo openclaw/openclaw \
  --ref main \
  -f tag="$VALIDATION_SHA" \
  -f preflight_only=true \
  -f npm_dist_tag=extended-stable \
  -f release_candidate_branch="$CONTEXT_REF"
```

This standalone run is a supplemental validation-only preflight. Do not pass
its run ID as publication `preflight_run_id`: its `main` workflow head is not
the canonical candidate branch/SHA identity required for standalone
publication evidence. Publication continues to use the integrated Full Release
Validation npm artifact and exact run attempt.

Classify failures before editing:

- Product: land another approved backport PR.
- Frozen-target tooling: backport only the smallest compatibility repair that
  tests the old product unchanged.
- Provider, approval, runner, or service: keep the candidate unchanged and use
  the bounded retry path.

Any branch change invalidates both gates. Once they pass, require the tip still
equals `VALIDATION_SHA`, then push signed `vYYYY.M.P`. Later changes need the next
patch; never move or delete the tag. Tagging fixes the immutable release
identity; it does not publish Docker images.

### Publish the npm packages

Publish every npm-publishable official plugin from the same SHA and save the
successful run ID:

```bash
RELEASE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
gh workflow run plugin-npm-release.yml \
  --ref extended-stable/YYYY.M.33 \
  -f publish_scope=all-publishable \
  -f ref="$RELEASE_SHA" \
  -f npm_dist_tag=extended-stable
```

The workflow covers all `all-publishable` packages, including unchanged ones,
and verifies every exact version and selector. Reruns reuse published versions.

Then publish the prepared core tarball with all three saved run identities:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-npm-release.yml \
  --ref extended-stable/YYYY.M.33 \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.P \
  -f preflight_only=false \
  -f npm_dist_tag=extended-stable \
  -f preflight_run_id=<npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<full-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<full-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f plugin_npm_run_id=<plugin-npm-run-id>
```

If the immutable candidate has already passed its saved preflight and Full
Release Validation but core publication needs a workflow-only recovery, dispatch
the trusted current-`main` workflow instead. Keep the same tag and evidence
identities; do not move the tag or republish plugins:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-npm-release.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.P \
  -f preflight_only=false \
  -f npm_dist_tag=extended-stable \
  -f release_candidate_branch=extended-stable/YYYY.M.33 \
  -f preflight_run_id=<npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<full-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<full-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f plugin_npm_run_id=<plugin-npm-run-id>
```

This recovery path checks out and publishes the immutable tag and requires the
canonical branch implied by that tag. It accepts Full Release Validation
evidence from the canonical candidate branch directly, from current `main`
directly when its workflow SHA is reachable from current `main`, or from the
trusted main-pinned harness. Every accepted form must attest the immutable
tag's SHA. Use it only when the candidate source and recorded evidence are
unchanged.

For non-production rehearsal only, add
`-f bypass_extended_stable_guard=true` to preflight and publish. It bypasses the
month guard only, never canonical-ref, SHA/tag/version equality, provenance,
approval, or readback checks. Never use it for production.

### Verify and recover

From a separate clean current-`main` checkout, not the frozen branch, run:

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-postpublish-verify.ts YYYY.M.P
npm view openclaw@YYYY.M.P version --userconfig "$(mktemp)"
npm view openclaw@extended-stable version --userconfig "$(mktemp)"
```

Require signatures and npm provenance for the canonical branch, plus publish,
preflight, and tarball-digest binding to the release SHA. Both commands must
return `YYYY.M.P`. Verify every prepared core package and `all-publishable`
official plugin at its exact version and selector.

If only the root selector fails, use the generated
`npm dist-tag add openclaw@YYYY.M.P extended-stable` repair command printed in
the workflow summary. Repair existing plugin or other prepared-core selectors
through approved credential-isolated tooling; the OIDC source cannot mutate
them. Never republish an immutable version.

Require `Docker Release` to verify exact default, slim, browser, and architecture
images in GHCR and Docker Hub, including attestations and platform versions. It
must advance only
`extended-stable`, `extended-stable-slim`, and `extended-stable-browser` by
digest; regular aliases remain unchanged and automatic rollback is rejected.

After that core registry readback succeeds, start Docker publication only through
`OpenClaw Release Publish`. Its Docker-only extended-stable path rechecks the
saved npm preflight artifact, exact `Full Release Validation` evidence, exact npm
version and `extended-stable` selector, and published tarball digest before it
calls the reusable `Docker Release` workflow. A tag push never publishes Docker
images by itself:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-release-publish.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.P \
  -f preflight_run_id=<npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<full-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<full-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f npm_dist_tag=extended-stable \
  -f publish_openclaw_npm=false \
  -f publish_docker_only=true
```

For alias repair, run approval-gated `Docker Channel Promotion` from current
`main` with the tag. It repeats digest, attestation, and platform checks, allows
an explicit rollback, and never rebuilds images.

Slack, Discord, and Codex are the initial documented support surfaces, not a
release allowlist: every npm-publishable official plugin ships. The regular
checklist alone owns beta/`latest`, GitHub Releases, ClawHub, native apps, mobile,
website, and private dist-tags; do not run those steps for this Gateway path.

## Regular release operator checklist

This checklist is the public shape of the release flow. Private credentials and service-specific signing, notarization, dist-tag recovery, and emergency rollback procedures stay in the maintainer-only release runbook.

`pnpm release:candidate` rejects fresh extended-stable launches, whether selected
with `--npm-dist-tag extended-stable` or inferred from a final `.33+` version.
Monthly correction suffixes are invalid; use a new monthly maintenance patch.
Follow [Monthly Gateway extended-stable publication](/reference/RELEASING#monthly-gateway-extended-stable-publication):
Full Release Validation, then the separate plugin npm and core npm publication owners.
The guard runs after trusted tooling, candidate/tag, optional artifact, and saved-state
checks, but before state writes, generated checks, plugin plans, or validation dispatch.
An npm preflight run alone does not make a launch a resumed full-validation run.
Explicit or restored full-validation run IDs and `--skip-dispatch` retain their
existing recovery behavior; they do not certify monthly publication through this helper.

An explicit stable or full release request includes macOS publication unless the operator limits its scope. That authorization carries through macOS validation, signing, notarization, promotion, and verification without a separate macOS consent step. Follow the current owner-configured environment policy and retain all enforced rules and exact-source artifact checks.

For beta, stable, and full profiles, Linux (`ubuntu`) cross-OS lanes gate npm publication. Windows and macOS cross-OS lanes run in parallel as advisory coverage; their failures remain visible under **advisory** in `release-ci-summary` and in the evidence manifest without blocking Release Decision or `pnpm release:candidate`. Selected lanes still finish for terminal evidence. npm qualification, Docker, Package Acceptance, normal CI, and the profile's performance and soak gates remain required. macOS app signing/notarization/appcast and Windows Hub asset promotion run in parallel with or after npm publication and never delay it; verify platform readiness separately.

1. Start from current `main`: pull latest, confirm the target commit is pushed, and confirm `main` CI is green enough to branch from.
2. Create `release/YYYY.M.PATCH` from that commit. Backports are optional; apply only the operator-selected set. Bump every required version location, run `pnpm release:prep`, finish release fixes and required forward-ports, and review `src/plugins/compat/registry.ts` plus `src/commands/doctor/shared/deprecation-compat.ts`.
3. Prepare the complete history manifest and release notes, then freeze the product-complete commit and target context as the **Code SHA/ref**, and record the trusted **Tooling SHA/ref**. Run the deterministic source preflight, then use `pnpm ci:full-release --sha <code-sha> --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH --workflow-sha <tooling-sha>`. Reuse those exact identities for later release validation; never refresh the tooling from moving `main`. Beta-publish uses `release_profile=beta` without soak; postpublish-confidence owns broad live, QA-live, mobile, and Parallels work.
4. Classify failures before editing as product, harness/tooling/provenance, infrastructure/credential, or wrapper. Only confirmed product failure creates a new Code SHA. Use one diagnosis, one fix when needed, and one narrow retry, then reassess.
5. Keep the top `CHANGELOG.md` section complete, user-facing and deduplicated, covering merged PRs and direct commits since the last reachable shipped tag. The full manifest and editorial pass may overlap Code validation. When a divergent shipped tag or later forward-port re-associates already-released PRs, pass it explicitly as `--shipped-ref`. A contribution-record target may be an ancestor of the final target; include later fixes honestly rather than inventing a self-referential SHA.
6. If the qualified Code SHA already contains fully final notes, use that same commit as **Release SHA**. One successful fresh full qualification can supply both lifecycle roles and their exact publication bytes; do not create another commit or run solely to separate the labels. If notes change after qualification, commit only `CHANGELOG.md` as a new Release SHA. Any other changed path returns the release to step 2.
7. When Code SHA equals Release SHA, retain its successful full validation parent and exact prepared npm/OCI descriptors. Only for a later genuine CHANGELOG-only descendant, optionally run SHA-pinned Full Release Validation with evidence reuse: the complete delta must be exactly `CHANGELOG.md`, and the parent must record `changelog-only-release-v1`, point at green Code evidence, and dispatch no product child lanes. That path still prepares and qualifies new Release SHA package/image bytes. Either path must satisfy every required profile gate. Regular final artifacts include SDK reports for both npm `beta` and `latest`; review the report and 8-character acknowledgement for the channel you will publish.
8. Save that successful Full Release Validation run as both the validation run and `preflight_run_id`. Its read-only npm workflow builds and packs the root/core packages once, checks source in parallel, and qualifies the exact bytes with the final changelog. Docker images build in parallel and are preserved for later promotion. Review the **Plugin SDK API diff** summary. If it reports changes, inspect the readable diff (also uploaded as `plugin-sdk-api-release-diff-<run-id>-<run-attempt>`) and record the 8-character acknowledgement digest printed by the report; omit the acknowledgement when it reports no Plugin SDK API changes. Standalone `OpenClaw NPM Release` with `preflight_only=true` remains available for focused preflight and recovery.

   Prepared packing reuses the exact preflight build while retaining package smoke checks, inventory generation, docs and changelog preparation, and source restoration. It also runs `pnpm update:compat:check` against npm's current `latest` and `beta` tags before packing. Ordinary source packing still performs a clean package build without that registry freshness check.

   If the packaged changelog exceeds 500 KiB, packaging keeps every editorial note and replaces only the complete contribution record with a link to the full record in the exact release tag's `CHANGELOG.md`. The full source changelog and contributor credits remain unchanged after postpack restoration. Editorial notes must still satisfy the release-note minimum, and packaging fails if the compact result still exceeds the cap.

9. Create the protected lightweight tooling tag at the recorded Tooling SHA using the [publish automation commands](#regular-release-publish-automation). Run the candidate helper against the untagged Release SHA with the successful Release-SHA validation parent and that tooling tag:

   ```bash
   pnpm release:candidate -- \
     --tag vYYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N \
     --target-sha <release-sha> \
     --full-release-run <release-sha-validation-run-id> \
     --publish-workflow-ref release-publish/<tooling-sha12>-<epoch> \
     --plugin-sdk-api-acknowledgement <reviewed-8-character-digest> \
     --skip-dispatch
   ```

   Include `--plugin-sdk-api-acknowledgement` only when the preflight reported Plugin SDK API changes. Stable candidates need no Windows tag. Optionally pass `--windows-node-tag vX.Y.Z` to record the approved installer digest map and include both Windows inputs in the printed publish command. Beta and alpha candidates defer Parallels install/update proof to the postpublish `pnpm release:beta-smoke` roster by default; pass `--run-parallels` only when the operator explicitly wants that proof before publish. Stable and full candidates run Parallels by default. The helper verifies release-note provenance, npm preflight bytes, and plugin publish plans, then prints the publish command. When admitted Full Release Validation evidence carries `coveragePolicy=npm-beta-v1`, it records Telegram package proof as `deferred-postpublish`; other evidence retains the existing Telegram check. After it completes green, create and push the final signed tag at that same Release SHA, then run the printed publish command.

   `pnpm release:candidate` validates the current frozen branch tip by default (or the explicit `--target-sha`), and rejects a tag that already exists. It records evidence before the final signed tag is pushed.

   The helper uses the qualified npm artifact bound by Full Release Validation. Supply `--npm-preflight-run` only to recover a separately prepared historical release. It never silently rebuilds a missing qualified artifact. Docker publication consumes the prepared OCI artifacts after checking the finalized tag and exact producer tuple; only registry writes and selector promotion hold the publication lock.

   `OpenClaw Release Publish` dispatches the selected or all-publishable plugin packages to npm and the same set to ClawHub in parallel, then promotes the prepared OpenClaw npm preflight artifact with the matching dist-tag once plugin npm publish succeeds. It keeps the GitHub release as a draft while it verifies registry readback, calls `Docker Release` with the immutable tag and Release SHA for beta and stable releases, and only then finalizes the GitHub release. npm-only alpha releases finalize after the required npm checks without scheduling Docker. The release checkout remains the product/data root, while planning and final verification execute from the exact trusted workflow-source checkout so an older release commit cannot silently use obsolete release tooling. Once publication binds the frozen Tooling SHA to an exact protected lightweight `release-publish/<12sha>-<provenance-run>` tag, that live tag-to-SHA mapping remains authoritative when `main` advances; the suffix records tag-creation provenance, not the current parent run id. Core and plugin npm publishers re-read that exact tag and revalidate the exact parent run tuple immediately before each npm publish or dist-tag mutation, failing closed on a missing, moved, annotated, or wrong-SHA tag, parent mismatch, or disallowed parent state. Other privileged writers require their dependent enforcement changes before the protected-tag publication route is globally complete. Before any publish child starts, it renders and caches the exact GitHub release body. When the complete matching `CHANGELOG.md` section fits GitHub's 125,000-character limit and the renderer's matching 125,000-byte safety ceiling, the page contains that exact `## YYYY.M.PATCH` section including its heading. When the source section does not fit, the page keeps the exact grouped editorial notes and replaces the oversized contribution record with a stable link to the full record in the tag-pinned `CHANGELOG.md`; partial records and truncated bullets are never published. The workflow chooses that full or compact body before adding `### Release verification`; if the proof tail would exceed the limit, it keeps the canonical body and relies on the immutable attached evidence instead. Stable releases published to npm `latest` become the GitHub latest release, while stable maintenance releases kept on npm `beta` are created with GitHub `latest=false`. The workflow also uploads the preflight dependency evidence, the full-validation manifest, and postpublish registry verification evidence to the GitHub release for post-release incident response. It prints child run IDs immediately, auto-approves release environment gates the workflow token is allowed to approve, summarizes failed child jobs with log tails, creates the draft GitHub release page up front, runs native Android qualification independently for a matching tagged Android pin (otherwise recording an explicit skip and shared mobile cutter remedy) and dispatches its publisher after the npm publisher succeeds without making GitHub finalization wait, waits for ClawHub staging only when `wait_for_clawhub=true` (the default `false` leaves that child detached), then runs the trusted-main beta verifier and uploads postpublish evidence for the GitHub release, npm package, selected plugin npm packages, staged ClawHub child workflow run IDs, and optional NPM Telegram run ID. The ClawHub bootstrap verifier requires the exact trusted-main workflow path and SHA, producer and terminal run attempts, release SHA, requested package set, immutable package artifact tuple, and terminal registry readback artifact; a successful legacy release-ref run is not accepted.

   Core npm dispatch and environment approval start as soon as plugin npm succeeds. Once the exact `npm-release` approval succeeds, the parent proceeds without waiting for core runner allocation. ClawHub inventory authorization and optional bootstrap completion can overlap the running core publish. A failed ClawHub authorization still fails the parent and leaves the GitHub release as a draft; the parent collects any already-started core result and records its evidence.

   Normal ClawHub publication uses a v2 child identity and a parent-owned immutable authorization receipt. The child seals the exact packed package inventory; the parent validates the live child attempt, approved package set, candidate SHA, and tooling identity before uploading the receipt. The child submits staged packages without waiting for public visibility. After the parent succeeds, `Plugin ClawHub Postpublish` verifies the exact parent and child attempts, immutable receipt and tarballs, and canonical registry bytes. That detached verification must succeed before announcing plugin publication complete. An explicit no-publication dispatch record distinguishes Docker-only or empty plugin scope from missing evidence. Failed-parent recovery still requires a separately valid parent receipt bound to the recovery child; an old child-bound receipt cannot authorize a new run.

   New npm preflight manifests record the producer's original qualified workflow ref, SHA, run ID, and attempt. Consumers compare that immutable tuple with the admitted producer; legacy manifests retain `legacy-unrecorded` provenance instead of inventing a full ref. ClawHub artifact readback proves package bytes and current registry metadata only: `publicationAuthentication: not-verified` does not attest how the historical publish authenticated.

   Then run the post-publish package acceptance against the published `openclaw@YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N` or `openclaw@beta` package. If a pushed or published prerelease needs a fix, cut the next matching prerelease number; never delete or rewrite the old one.

10. On a failed publish attempt, keep the Release SHA unchanged unless the failure proves a product or changelog defect. Resume successful immutable children and artifacts; never rebuild or republish a package version that already succeeded. An app failure is an independent recovery task: retain its summary and evidence, and recover that platform without rerunning npm or keeping the GitHub release drafted.
11. For stable, publish through `OpenClaw Release Publish` after Full Release Validation and candidate evidence pass, reusing the successful preflight artifact via `preflight_run_id`. Plugin npm publication gates core npm; ClawHub runs in parallel. The GitHub release finalizes after npm and Docker evidence passes. Run macOS through the validation, preflight, and publish workflows in `openclaw/releases`; its `.zip`, `.dmg`, `.dSYM.zip`, and signed `appcast.xml` retain their own verification requirements. Windows Hub and Android also attach their verified assets independently. Android dispatch starts after core npm succeeds and may finish after the GitHub release becomes public. Supply both optional Windows inputs to schedule promotion after GitHub publication, or use the [manual recovery command](#regular-release-publish-automation) later. App approval, build, signing, promotion, or failure never delays npm or the GitHub release.
12. After publish, run the npm post-publish verifier, optional standalone published-npm Telegram E2E when you need post-publish channel proof, dist-tag promotion when needed, and verify the generated GitHub release page. Announce the published surfaces accurately, then complete [Stable main closeout](#stable-main-closeout), recording pending apps explicitly. App workflows can finish afterward; verify their assets and the macOS appcast before announcing those platforms complete.

## Stable main closeout

Stable publication is not complete until `main` carries the actual shipped release state.

1. Start from fresh latest `main`. Audit `release/YYYY.M.PATCH` against it and forward-port real fixes absent from `main`. Do not blindly merge release-only compatibility, test, or validation adapters into newer `main`.
2. For the normal path, set `main` to the shipped stable version. A late closeout may use `main` after it has advanced to a later stable OpenClaw CalVer; do not downgrade an already-started release train solely to close the prior release. The validator still requires the exact shipped changelog section and records the actual `main` version and SHA. It requires the matching appcast entry once the macOS release has published; until then it records `appcast: pending`. Run `pnpm release:prep` after any root version change.
3. Make `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## YYYY.M.PATCH` section on `main` exactly match the tagged release branch. Include the stable `appcast.xml` update when the mac release published one.
4. Do not add `YYYY.M.PATCH+1`, a beta version, or an empty future changelog section to `main` until the operator explicitly starts that release train.
5. Run `pnpm release:generated:check`, `pnpm deps:npm-lock:check`, and `OPENCLAW_TESTBOX=1 pnpm check:changed`. Push, then verify `origin/main` contains the shipped version and changelog before calling the stable release done.
6. Keep the repository variables `RELEASE_ROLLBACK_DRILL_ID` and `RELEASE_ROLLBACK_DRILL_DATE` current after each private rollback drill.

`OpenClaw Stable Main Closeout` starts from the `main` push that carries the shipped version and changelog after stable publication; apps may still be pending. Include the appcast once macOS publishes. It reads immutable postpublish evidence to bind the shipped tag to its Full Release Validation and Publish runs, then verifies the stable main state, release, mandatory stable soak, and blocking performance evidence. It attaches an immutable closeout manifest and checksum to the GitHub release. The manifest records `appPlatforms` with `macos`, `windows`, and `android` each `pending` or `attached`; aggregate `apps` is `attached` only when every required platform asset has a lowercase `sha256:<64hex>` digest. At the first closeout, `appcast` is `pending` unless the full macOS zip/DMG/dSYM asset set is attached with canonical digests; a complete macOS set requires appcast verification and records `verified`. Replay preserves the initial app snapshot and requires every recorded asset name and digest to match exactly. Later canonical app attachments are allowed, while changed or deleted recorded assets and unrelated additions remain errors. Recorded app, recovery, and asset fields remain byte-identical while authoritative release fields are recomputed. When macOS attaches after closeout, replay also checks its entry in the current main appcast; it preserves an appcast already verified at the original closeout. The automatic push trigger skips legacy releases that predate immutable postpublish evidence and never treats that skip as a completed closeout.

A complete closeout requires the closeout manifest asset and its matching checksum. A partial manifest replays its recorded `main` SHA and rollback drill to regenerate identical bytes, then attaches the missing checksum; an invalid pair, or a checksum without a manifest, stays blocking. A push-triggered run without rollback drill repository variables skips without completing closeout; a missing or more-than-90-day-old drill record still blocks manual evidence-backed closeout. Private recovery commands remain in the maintainer-only runbook. Use manual dispatch only to repair or replay an evidence-backed stable closeout.

If the Release Publish parent failed only after immutable npm/plugin evidence was attached, repair and verify the required npm, Docker, and GitHub publication surfaces. A maintainer may then manually dispatch closeout with `allow_failed_publish_recovery=true`; that mode accepts only a completed failed parent and preserves the publication evidence checks. Pending apps do not block recovery; the closeout records their state, and a published macOS release still requires a valid appcast. Automatic push closeout never enables this recovery mode. When core npm succeeded but the original parent failed during postpublish readback, an independently successful Docker-only publisher may supply the Docker proof. The checksummed postpublish evidence must select both runs through `operatorRecovery.npmPublishRunId` and `operatorRecovery.dockerPromotionRunId`. These are selectors, not proof: closeout verifies exact Actions attempts, successful publication jobs, immutable dispatch artifacts, protected tooling, qualified source and Full Release Validation bindings. For historical publishers without complete receipts, only the unique Actions-generated input group of each named successful step supplies missing bindings. Supported legacy whole-job logs additionally require the frozen publisher shell-body hash, exact step number, and successful API step time window; arbitrary command output is never evidence. Split recovery is bound to the exact requested tag; correction tags cannot borrow another tag’s recovery proof merely because they share a commit. It independently verifies npm registry signatures, tarball hashes, and Sigstore provenance, plus Docker image and attestation descriptors against the qualified OCI manifest. Missing, expired, ambiguous, or mismatched evidence blocks recovery. The closeout records the failed original parent and both successful publication attempts; replay must independently verify the same immutable recovery record.

A legacy fallback correction tag may reuse base-package evidence only when the correction tag resolves to the same source commit as the base stable tag. Its Android release reuses the base tag's verified APK and adds provenance for the correction tag. A correction with different source must publish and verify its own package evidence and use a higher Android `versionCode`.

For correction artifact preparation, validate the immutable SHA with `--target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH-N` before tagging, or the exact `vYYYY.M.PATCH-N` context after tagging. The existing `target_context_ref` workflow input carries the same context. This preserves the intended correction tag in both npm and Docker artifacts; a base-version package is accepted only when `vYYYY.M.PATCH` resolves to that same SHA. The package bytes keep their original version, and publishers still require artifacts sealed for the exact final tag. A base-context Full Release Validation run does not authorize reusing its base-tag publication artifacts for a correction.

## Release preflight

### Previous updater compatibility

Before freezing the release, refresh `scripts/lib/update-compat-inventory.json`
from every release in the supported upgrade window. The current window includes
2026.9.1, 2026.9.2, and 2026.9.3. Download each npm tarball and verify it against
its published `dist.integrity` before extracting it. Pass each verified artifact
to the recorder with a repeatable `--release` argument:

```bash
pnpm update:compat:gen \
  --release '<unpacked-2026.9.1-directory>=<verified-npm-dist.integrity>' \
  --release '<unpacked-2026.9.2-directory>=<verified-npm-dist.integrity>' \
  --release '<unpacked-2026.9.3-directory>=<verified-npm-dist.integrity>'
```

The recorder writes releases in version order and replaces the recorded set.
Drop releases older than the supported upgrade window when regenerating it;
the inventory must not accumulate indefinitely. A release with no post-swap
imports still has an entry with an empty chunk list, so coverage is explicit.
Conflicting origins for the same chunk export across releases fail generation.

`pnpm update:compat:check` reads `npm view openclaw dist-tags --json` and requires
the versions tagged `latest` and `beta` to be present, even when both tags refer
to stable versions or the same version. A missing version fails with the exact
`pnpm update:compat:gen` command to run after verifying and unpacking the listed
artifacts. `pnpm release:prep`, version preparation, and prepared-release packing
run this check. Ordinary PR checks and source packing do not query npm for it.
To verify deterministic regeneration offline, run `pnpm update:compat:check`
with the same `--release` arguments used for generation.

The recorder scans emitted lazy imports in the updater, service, and CLI cleanup source
regions and records required export origins. The wizard entry is excluded
because it starts before replacement. `runtime-postbuild` generates hashed
compatibility files by re-exporting the candidate's corresponding symbols;
multiple exports of one declaration resolve to its own chunk, with sorted paths
and export names breaking alias ties. Missing mappings or distinct declaration
bindings for the same source origin fail the build. The isolated `config-doctor`
graph cannot supply updater bridges. Stable entrypoints are checked
without replacement. The package carries the inventory in
`dist/update-compat-inventory.json`, so negative and future fixtures remove that
candidate's bridges. Existing older compatibility aliases remain separately
owned by their original upgrade contracts.

The default `update-first-hop-compat` lane runs each recorded release against the
candidate, with separate artifacts per version. Published updaters may correctly
skip a same-version tarball, so the lane stamps only test-artifact version metadata:
first hop `2026.9.99-first-hop.0` retains compatibility bridges; second hop
`2026.9.99-first-hop.1` removes them. The original candidate stays unchanged, and
transformation receipts bind package digests and every changed or removed member.
Both hops still require the exact installed build identity and a restarted service. The 2026.9.1 negative control demonstrates the
missing restart import; releases that already preload that helper record the
negative control as not applicable while retaining the positive first-hop and
bridge-free future-hop checks. An explicit source tarball still selects one
baseline. Run the published upgrade survivor lane from the oldest supported
release as well. Native Windows proof must invoke the old updater with
a registered Scheduled Task and verify its restart without a subsequent manual
`gateway start`. Import compatibility alone does not prove that old and new
modules share process-local state.

### Design proposal: immutable runtime generations

A durable replacement would install each version in an immutable generation
directory and switch an installation pointer. Launchers must resolve that
pointer before starting Node so lazy imports keep the process's original tree.
Retain generations until their processes have exited. This is a proposal, not
the current update layout.

The design must preserve npm's ownership and bookkeeping: `npm ls -g`, later
global installs and uninstall, lifecycle scripts, and generated launchers must
still work. Unix uses `<prefix>/lib/node_modules` and `<prefix>/bin`; Windows
uses `<prefix>/node_modules` and prefix-root launchers. A mutable junction alone
does not pin old imports, and Windows pointer replacement must respect open
handles and junction semantics. npm must not replace or orphan the retained
generation anchor during its next install.

pnpm owns a global project, manifests, lockfiles, virtual-store links, and
version-dependent package groups; its cleanup must not collect live generations.
Bun also owns a shared global project and separate binary directory, and its
Windows binary launchers currently cannot be relocated by this updater.
Generation activation must preserve sibling packages and the existing
concurrent-project checks for both managers. These constraints need separate
design approval and package-manager integration proof before implementation.

### Required checks

- Run `pnpm check:test-types` before release preflight so test TypeScript stays covered outside the faster local `pnpm check` gate.
- Run `pnpm check:architecture` before release preflight so the broader import cycle and architecture boundary checks are green outside the faster local gate.
- Run `pnpm build && pnpm ui:build` before `pnpm release:check` so the expected `dist/*` release artifacts and Control UI bundle exist for the pack validation step.
- Run `pnpm release:prep` after the root version bump and before tagging. It runs every deterministic release generator that commonly drifts after a version or config change: plugin versions, plugin inventory, base config schema, bundled channel config metadata, config docs baseline, plugin SDK exports, and Control UI locale bundles. It also blocks until native app translations and platform-generated locale resources match the source inventory; if they lag, wait for or dispatch `Native App Locale Refresh` before freezing the Code SHA. `pnpm release:check` re-runs those guards plus transient npm package-lock validation in check mode (including the strict locale gates plus the plugin SDK surface budget) and reports every failure in one pass before running package release checks. The npm preflight separately compares the exact release SHA with the prior published dist-tag and reports any Plugin SDK API changes.
- For reviewed native translation repairs, configure the translation provider and run `pnpm native:i18n:sync --locale <code> --refresh-id <native-id>`. Find IDs in `apps/.i18n/native-source.json`; repeat the selector for up to 64 distinct IDs. Selected entries join ordinary pending work, including missing strings and glossary invalidation. Requests include bounded nearby owner code and instructions to preserve printf argument roles; excerpts are request-only and do not enter the source inventory. Unknown IDs fail before provider work, and selected refresh cannot be combined with `--force`. Then run `pnpm native:i18n:sync` to regenerate platform resources and `pnpm native:i18n:check` to validate them.
- For reviewed Control UI translation repairs, run `pnpm ui:i18n:sync --locale <code> --refresh-key <key>`. Repeat the selector for up to 64 distinct catalog keys. It refreshes those keys alongside ordinary pending work while leaving still-valid unselected cached aliases reusable. A configured provider is required even when ordinary synchronization allows optional authentication; unknown keys and combining selected refresh with `--force` are rejected.
- Plugin version sync updates the publishable `@openclaw/ai` runtime package, official plugin package versions, and existing `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` floors to the OpenClaw release version by default. Treat that field as the plugin SDK/runtime API floor, not just a copy of the package version: for plugin-only releases that intentionally remain compatible with older OpenClaw hosts, keep the floor at the oldest supported host API and document that choice in the plugin release proof.
- Run the manual `Full Release Validation` workflow before release approval to select the pre-release test boxes from one entrypoint. It accepts a branch, tag, or full commit SHA and dispatches manual `CI`, plugin prerelease, and `OpenClaw Release Checks` for the selected profile. Canonical beta `all` without soak uses the bounded `npm-beta-v1` policy described in [Full release validation](/reference/full-release-validation); install, package, Linux cross-OS, QA parity, runtime-pair/restart, and tool-coverage gates remain; Windows/macOS cross-OS outcomes are advisory. Stable and full runs always include exhaustive live/E2E and Docker release-path soak; `run_release_soak=true` requests an explicit beta soak. Package Acceptance provides package Telegram E2E when selected, avoiding a second concurrent live poller for an unpublished candidate.

  Provide `release_package_spec` after publishing a beta to reuse the shipped npm package across release checks, Package Acceptance, and package Telegram E2E without rebuilding the release tarball. Provide `npm_telegram_package_spec` only when Telegram should use a different published package from the rest of release validation. Provide `package_acceptance_package_spec` when Package Acceptance should use a different published package from the release package spec. Provide `evidence_package_spec` when the release evidence report should prove that validation matches a published npm package without forcing Telegram E2E.

  ```bash
  TOOLING_SHA="<recorded-full-main-ancestor-sha>"
  pnpm ci:full-release \
    --sha <code-sha> \
    --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
    --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"
  ```

- Run the manual `Package Acceptance` workflow when you want side-channel proof for a package candidate while release work continues. Use `source=npm` for `openclaw@beta`, `openclaw@latest`, or an exact release version; `source=ref` to pack a trusted `package_ref` branch/tag/SHA with the current `workflow_ref` harness; `source=url` for a public HTTPS tarball with a required SHA-256 and strict public URL policy; `source=trusted-url` for a named trusted-source policy using required `trusted_source_id` and SHA-256; or `source=artifact` for a tarball uploaded by another GitHub Actions run.

  The workflow resolves the candidate to `package-under-test`, reuses the Docker E2E release scheduler against that tarball, and can run Telegram QA against the same tarball with `telegram_mode=mock-openai` or `telegram_mode=live-frontier`. When the selected Docker lanes include `published-upgrade-survivor`, the package artifact is the candidate and `published_upgrade_survivor_baseline` selects the published baseline. `update-restart-auth` uses the candidate package as both the installed CLI and the package-under-test so it exercises the candidate update command's managed restart path.

  Example:

  ```bash
  gh workflow run package-acceptance.yml --ref main -f workflow_ref=main -f source=npm -f package_spec=openclaw@beta -f suite_profile=product -f published_upgrade_survivor_baseline=openclaw@2026.4.26 -f telegram_mode=mock-openai
  ```

  Common profiles:
  - `smoke`: install/channel/agent, gateway network, and config reload lanes
  - `package`: artifact-native package/update/restart/plugin lanes without OpenWebUI or live ClawHub
  - `product`: package profile plus MCP channels, cron/subagent cleanup, OpenAI web search, and OpenWebUI
  - `full`: Docker release-path chunks with OpenWebUI
  - `custom`: exact `docker_lanes` selection for a focused rerun

- Run the manual `CI` workflow directly when you only need deterministic normal CI coverage for the release candidate. Manual CI dispatches bypass changed scoping and force the Linux Node shards, bundled-plugin shards, plugin and channel contract shards, Node 24 minimum compatibility, `check-*`, `check-additional-*`, built-artifact smoke checks, docs checks, Python skills, Windows, macOS, and Control UI i18n lanes. Standalone manual CI defaults to full coverage and runs Android only with `include_android=true`. Full Release Validation includes Android except under `npm-beta-v1`, which selects `release_scope=npm-beta` and defers native app CI while retaining macOS and Windows Node checks.

  ```bash
  gh workflow run ci.yml --ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH -f include_android=true
  ```

- Run `pnpm qa:otel:smoke` when validating release telemetry. It exercises QA-lab through a local OTLP/HTTP receiver and verifies trace, metric, and log export plus bounded trace attributes and content/identifier redaction without requiring Opik, Langfuse, or another external collector.
- Run `pnpm qa:otel:collector-smoke` when validating collector compatibility. It routes the same QA-lab OTLP export through a real OpenTelemetry Collector Docker container before the local receiver assertions.
- Run `pnpm qa:prometheus:smoke` when validating protected Prometheus scraping. It exercises QA-lab, rejects unauthenticated scrapes, and verifies release-critical metric families stay free of prompt content, raw identifiers, auth tokens, and local paths.
- Run `pnpm qa:observability:smoke` for the source-checkout OpenTelemetry and Prometheus smoke lanes back to back.
- Run `pnpm release:check` before every tagged release.
- `OpenClaw NPM Preflight` packs the publishable tarball once, then generates dependency release evidence while qualifying those exact bytes. The npm advisory vulnerability gate is release-blocking. The transitive manifest risk, dependency ownership/install surface, dependency change, and npm package-lock mirror reports are release evidence only. The npm mirrors include the root package and every publishable workspace package with runtime dependencies or optional dependencies, generated and verified against the source checkout’s `pnpm-lock.yaml`. They are never included in npm tarballs. The dependency change report compares the release candidate with the previous reachable release tag. The preflight uploads dependency evidence as `openclaw-release-dependency-evidence-<tag>` and also embeds it under `dependency-evidence/` inside the prepared npm preflight artifact. The real publish path reuses that preflight artifact, then attaches the same evidence to the GitHub release as `openclaw-<version>-dependency-evidence.zip`.
- **Downstream packagers:** Download `openclaw-<version>-dependency-evidence.zip` from the GitHub release and read `dependency-evidence/npm-package-locks.json` (`schemaVersion: 1`). Select the entry in `packages` matching the exact package `name` and `version` you pin. Every entry has an `omittedWorkspaceDependencies` array; a nonempty array marks a partial lock, and consumers must reject that entry instead of installing it. Sibling workspace packages publish in the same release, so the generator omits their `workspace:` runtime references at preflight. The top-level `packagesWithOmittedWorkspaceDependencies` counts these partial entries. Only for an entry with an empty omissions array, serialize `entry.lock` as `package-lock.json` (two-space JSON indentation plus a trailing newline reproduces `entry.lockSha256`). This supports offline installation of lockless packages such as `@openclaw/acpx`; the report includes a `bundleRuntimeDependencies` flag and direct dependency counts. Before using a lock, verify that `dependency-evidence/dependency-evidence-manifest.json`’s `releaseSha` equals the report’s `sourceSha` and the OpenClaw commit you pin. The report also records the source `pnpm-lock.yaml` SHA-256. The companion `npm-package-locks.md` provides counts and a package table. The locks encode this repository's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides (for example a scoped `@openai/codex` pin for `codex-acp`), so nested dependency specs may not satisfy the locked versions by range alone: before running `npm ci`, either carry the same `overrides` in the consuming `package.json` or rewrite each entry's nested `dependencies`/`optionalDependencies` specs to the locked versions (nix-openclaw does the latter); a raw `npm ci` against an unmodified `package.json` otherwise fails its lock-sync check.
- Run `OpenClaw Release Publish` for the mutating publish sequence after the tag exists. Dispatch regular beta and stable publishes from the protected `release-publish/<tooling-sha12>-<epoch>` tag at the frozen Tooling SHA; the release tag still selects the exact target commit and may point into `release/YYYY.M.PATCH`. Tideclaw alpha publishes remain on their matching alpha branch. Pass the successful OpenClaw npm `preflight_run_id`, successful `full_release_validation_run_id`, and exact `full_release_validation_run_attempt`, and keep the default plugin publish scope `all-publishable` unless you are deliberately running a focused repair. The workflow dispatches plugin npm and ClawHub together, then starts core npm once plugin npm succeeds. Core npm does not wait for ClawHub authorization or bootstrap; the exact ClawHub receipt remains a required parent step. When the tagged Android pin matches the stable release train, Android qualification runs independently and dispatch follows successful core npm publication; a mismatched pin records an explicit skip. Optional Windows promotion starts after GitHub finalization as a detached child. Android approval, build, and publication are monitored separately and do not hold core publication; the child can attach its verified assets after the GitHub release becomes public. Publish reruns are resumable: an already-published core npm version skips the core dispatch after the workflow proves the registry tarball matches the tag's preflight artifact, and Windows/Android promotion is skipped when the release already carries the verified asset contract, so a retry only redoes the failed stages. Focused plugin-only repairs require `plugin_publish_scope=selected` and a nonempty plugin list. Plugin-only `all-publishable` runs require complete immutable preflight and Full Release Validation evidence; partial evidence is rejected.
- Stable `OpenClaw Release Publish` accepts optional `windows_node_tag` and `windows_node_installer_digests` inputs together. Omit both to skip Windows dispatch. When supplied, the parent finalizes the GitHub release on npm and Docker evidence, then dispatches `Windows Node Release` independently with the approved digest map unchanged. The child validates the exact published, non-prerelease source release, downloads the signed x64/ARM64 installers, matches the pinned digests, verifies the expected OpenClaw Foundation Authenticode signer on Windows, and attaches the installers plus SHA-256 manifest to the published OpenClaw release. It re-downloads the promoted assets to verify membership and hashes. Windows failures are reported in the child summary and evidence without failing the parent or reverting the public release to draft.

  To attach Windows assets later or recover promotion, use the [manual recovery command](#regular-release-publish-automation) with exact target/source tags and the approved `expected_installer_digests` map. Recovery rejects unexpected `OpenClawCompanion-*` asset names before replacing the expected contract with the pinned source bytes. Website download links should target exact OpenClaw release asset URLs for the current stable release, or `releases/latest/download/...` only after verifying GitHub's latest redirect points at that same release; do not link only to the companion repo release page.

- Release checks run in a separate manual workflow: `OpenClaw Release Checks`. The `all`, `qa-parity`, and direct `qa` groups select QA Lab parity, runtime-pair/restart proof, and runtime tool coverage. The Matrix catalog and Telegram QA-live lanes run for stable/full all-group validation, soak-enabled all-group validation, or an explicit `qa`/`qa-live` rerun group. Bounded beta-publish `all` without soak defers those live lanes to postpublish-confidence. The live lanes use the `qa-live-shared` environment; Telegram also uses Convex CI credential leases.
- Cross-OS install and upgrade runtime validation is part of public `OpenClaw Release Checks` and `Full Release Validation`, which call the reusable workflow `.github/workflows/openclaw-cross-os-release-checks-reusable.yml` directly. Linux cross-OS lanes gate publication. Windows and macOS lanes run alongside them as advisory coverage, with actual pass/fail conclusions retained in the manifest and summary; their failures do not block npm publication.
- Secret-bearing release checks should be dispatched through `Full Release Validation` or from the `main`/release workflow ref so workflow logic and secrets stay controlled.
- `OpenClaw Release Checks` accepts a branch, tag, or full commit SHA as long as the resolved commit is reachable from an OpenClaw branch or release tag.
- `OpenClaw NPM Release` validation-only preflight also accepts the current full 40-character workflow-branch commit SHA without requiring a pushed tag. The SHA dispatch stays read-only; later publication requires a real release tag at the same validated SHA. In SHA mode the workflow synthesizes `v<package.json version>` only for the package metadata check; real publish still requires a real release tag.
- Both workflows keep the real publish and promotion path on GitHub-hosted runners, while the non-mutating validation path can use the larger Blacksmith Linux runners.
- That workflow runs `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_CACHE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live:cache` using both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` workflow secrets.
- npm release preflight no longer waits on the separate release checks lane.
- Before tagging a release candidate locally, run `RELEASE_TAG=vYYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N pnpm release:fast-pretag-check`. The helper runs the fast release guardrails, plugin npm/ClawHub release checks, build, UI build, and `release:openclaw:npm:check` in the order that catches common approval-blocking mistakes before the GitHub publish workflow starts.
- Plugin `openclaw.release.requireLatestDependencies` declarations remain release metadata, but npm `latest` drift is advisory. Checks warn with the plugin, dependency, pinned version, and current latest version; a failed latest lookup also warns and does not establish that the pin is unusable. Full Release Validation's Codex lanes validate the `@openclaw/codex` harness pin. Keep that frozen, tested pin when upstream publishes a newer version. Missing or malformed required runtime dependency metadata, package/install failures, and failed required validation lanes still block release.
- Run `RELEASE_TAG=vYYYY.M.PATCH node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-release-check.ts` (or the matching prerelease/correction tag) before approval.
- After npm publish, run `node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-postpublish-verify.ts YYYY.M.PATCH` (or the matching beta/correction version) to verify the published registry install path in a fresh temp prefix.
- After a beta publish, run `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_PACKAGE_SPEC=openclaw@YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_CREDENTIAL_ROLE=maintainer pnpm test:docker:npm-telegram-live` with `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` and `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_MAINTAINER` set. This verifies installed-package onboarding, Telegram setup, and real Telegram E2E against the published npm package using the shared Test Server userbot pool. CI uses the `ci` role and `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_CI` instead.
- To run the full post-publish beta smoke from a maintainer machine, use `pnpm release:beta-smoke -- --beta betaN`. The helper runs Parallels npm update/fresh-target validation, dispatches `NPM Telegram Beta E2E`, polls the exact workflow run, downloads the artifact, and prints the Telegram report.
- Maintainers can run the same post-publish check from GitHub Actions via the manual `NPM Telegram Beta E2E` workflow. It is intentionally manual-only and does not run on every merge.
- Maintainer release automation uses preflight-then-promote:
  - Real npm publish must pass a successful npm `preflight_run_id`.
  - Regular beta and stable publish orchestration and preflight use trusted `main` against the exact target tag. Tideclaw alpha publish and preflight use the matching alpha branch.
  - Stable npm releases default to `beta`; stable npm publish can target `latest` explicitly via workflow input.
  - Token-based npm dist-tag mutation lives in `openclaw/releases/.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-dist-tags.yml` because `npm dist-tag add` still needs `NPM_TOKEN` while the source repo keeps OIDC-only publish.
  - Public `macOS Release` is validation-only; when a tag lives only on a release branch but the workflow is dispatched from `main`, set `public_release_branch=release/YYYY.M.PATCH`.
  - Real macOS publish must pass successful macOS `preflight_run_id` and `validate_run_id` in `openclaw/releases`. These app gates run independently and never hold npm or GitHub release finalization.
  - Real publish paths promote prepared artifacts instead of rebuilding them again.
- For stable correction releases like `YYYY.M.PATCH-N`, the post-publish verifier also checks the same temp-prefix upgrade path from `YYYY.M.PATCH` to `YYYY.M.PATCH-N` so release corrections cannot silently leave older global installs on the base stable payload.
- npm release preflight fails closed unless the tarball includes both `dist/control-ui/index.html` and a non-empty `dist/control-ui/assets/` payload, so we do not ship an empty browser dashboard again.
- Post-publish verification also checks that published plugin entrypoints and package metadata are present in the installed registry layout. A release that ships missing plugin runtime payloads fails the postpublish verifier and cannot be promoted to `latest`.
- `pnpm test:install:smoke` also enforces the npm pack `unpackedSize` budget on the candidate update tarball, so installer e2e catches accidental pack bloat before the release publish path.
- If the release work touched CI planning, extension timing manifests, or extension test matrices, regenerate and review the planner-owned `plugin-prerelease-extension-shard` matrix outputs from `.github/workflows/plugin-prerelease.yml` before approval so release notes do not describe a stale CI layout.
- Stable macOS release readiness also includes the updater surfaces: the GitHub release must end up with the packaged `.zip`, `.dmg`, and `.dSYM.zip`; `appcast.xml` on `main` must point at the new stable zip after publish (the macOS publish workflow commits it automatically, or opens an appcast PR when direct push is blocked); the packaged app must keep a non-debug bundle id, a non-empty Sparkle feed URL, and a `CFBundleVersion` at or above the canonical Sparkle build floor for that release version.
- Signed macOS packaging retains `dist/macos-notarization-recovery/` before waiting for Apple. It contains the exact signed app archive, symbols, submission IDs, available DMG, and source-bound SHA-256 inventory. Keep the complete checkpoint if notarization fails; do not rebuild or replace its files. Successful packaging marks it complete for artifact retention; the next ordinary package invocation verifies and retires that completed checkpoint automatically.
- Resume with `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh --resume-notarization` from the same source commit and version, with the original signing/notary credentials available. Recovery verifies the checkpoint, restores the signed app, and waits on existing Apple submissions. It creates a DMG only if that packaging step had not completed. Apple rejection, changed bytes, wrong source/version, or invalid signatures remain failures.

## Release test boxes

`Full Release Validation` is how operators kick off the full product matrix from one entrypoint. Use the helper so every child workflow runs from a temporary branch fixed at one trusted `main` workflow SHA while the requested commit remains the candidate under test:

```bash
TOOLING_SHA="<recorded-full-main-ancestor-sha>"
pnpm ci:full-release \
  --sha <code-sha> \
  --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"
```

The helper verifies that the recorded Tooling SHA remains reachable from current
`origin/main`, pushes `release-ci/<workflow-sha>-...` at that exact commit,
accepts only the release branch's final package version or a matching beta
prerelease, infers `beta` for that beta path and `stable` for final versions, and
dispatches `Full Release Validation` with the Validation SHA as `expected_sha`.
Target resolution rejects a mismatch before child dispatch. Every child workflow
`headSha` must match the Tooling SHA. Pass `-f reuse_evidence=false` to force a
fresh run or `-f release_profile=full` for the broad advisory sweep. Never
replace the recorded Tooling SHA with a fresh `main` lookup. The helper rejects
pinned tooling that lacks the current release-isolation contract or the
`expected_sha` dispatch input and never silently selects newer tooling. The
workflow itself never writes repository refs. Tideclaw alpha validation remains
on its matching alpha branch and exact alpha tag rather than a regular
`release/*` context.

That current-`main` lineage check authorizes the initial validation tooling
selection only. It is not permission to choose newer tooling after the
candidate SHA/ref and Tooling SHA/ref are frozen. Once publication binds the
Tooling SHA to the protected lightweight `release-publish/*` tag, the exact live
tag-to-SHA mapping and exact parent run tuple authorize the npm mutations
enforced by this foundation even if `main` has advanced. Other privileged
writers remain blocked until their dependent enforcement changes land.

If the fresh qualified commit already contains final notes, Code SHA and Release SHA are identical. Use that same successful parent/attempt and its exact prepared bytes for candidate and publication checks, including the final channel-specific SDK report and required acknowledgement. No second commit or FRV is required merely to name a Release SHA.

If notes change afterward, commit only `CHANGELOG.md` and optionally run the same helper with the new Release SHA:

```bash
TOOLING_SHA="<same-recorded-tooling-sha>"
pnpm ci:full-release \
  --sha <release-sha> \
  --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"
```

This optional second parent reuses product evidence only when GitHub proves the Release SHA descends from the Code SHA and the complete changed path set is exactly `CHANGELOG.md`. It records `changelog-only-release-v1` and dispatches no product children. Npm preflight and package/install acceptance still run on the Release SHA because its tarball bytes changed.

For a fresh Code SHA, the workflow resolves the target, dispatches manual `CI`, then dispatches `OpenClaw Release Checks`. Beta-publish maps to `release_profile=beta` and `run_release_soak=false`. An `all` run for an actual beta package on its matching canonical release branch or beta tag records `coveragePolicy=npm-beta-v1`: Linux/macOS/Windows Node, Control UI, plugin, package, Linux cross-OS, and QA parity/runtime/restart/tool gates remain; Windows/macOS cross-OS outcomes are advisory; native apps, performance, and published-package Telegram confidence are deferred. Beta `all` without soak also defers broad live/E2E, QA-live, and Package Acceptance Telegram. Postpublish-confidence uses the exact published package with soak or explicit focused groups. Stable-publish maps to `release_profile=stable`. The final verifier summary includes slowest-job tables for each selected child run.

Deferred coverage is recorded as **not run**, never passed. It does not shorten
the terminal-evidence requirement for selected children. `main`, alpha, and
non-beta targets do not qualify for `npm-beta-v1`; stable, full, soak-enabled,
and focused runs retain their existing coverage. Native artifact publication
still requires its build, signing, notarization, and promotion gates.

Each dispatcher records the exact child run ID and attempt, then exits. Release
Decision reports a decisive blocker without waiting for unrelated diagnostic
tails; with `fail_fast=false`, Diagnostic Drain keeps the selected children
running to terminal. Diagnose `blocked_diagnostics_running` immediately, but do
not retry until the drain is terminal. Recover `orchestration_error` against
the same exact children and never redispatch tests merely to repair collection.
An immutable run-bound execution plan preserves the original attempt, titles,
coverage, gates, and child tuples across collector retries. The final verifier
consumes that plan and the exact attempt-bound Decision and Drain artifacts
instead of polling or reclassifying child results.

When selected, the product-performance child is artifact-only in this release
path. The umbrella dispatches it with `publish_reports=false`, and validation
is rejected unless its artifact-only guard proves that the Clawgrit report
publisher stayed skipped. `npm-beta-v1` defers this child to confidence work.
An early standalone beta performance run is optional signal, not another
mandatory prepublish wait; record available results and any observed regression.

See [Full release validation](/reference/full-release-validation) for the complete stage matrix, exact workflow job names, stable versus full profile differences, artifacts, and focused rerun handles.

Child workflows are dispatched from the SHA-pinned trusted ref that runs `Full Release Validation`. Every child run must use the exact parent workflow SHA. Do not use raw `--ref main -f ref=<sha>` dispatches for release proof; use `pnpm ci:full-release --sha <target-sha> --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH --workflow-sha <tooling-sha>`.

Use `release_profile` to select live/provider breadth:

- `beta`: fastest release-critical OpenAI/core live and Docker path
- `stable`: beta plus stable provider/backend coverage for release approval
- `full`: stable plus broad advisory provider/media coverage

Stable and full validation always run the exhaustive live/E2E, Docker release-path, and bounded published upgrade-survivor sweep before promotion. Use `run_release_soak=true` to request that same sweep for a beta. The sweep resolves the latest stable baseline once and runs the reported-issue upgrade fixtures against it. Broader historical migration coverage remains available through the separate manual `Update Migration` workflow.

`OpenClaw Release Checks` uses the trusted workflow ref to resolve the target ref once as `release-package-under-test` and reuses that artifact in cross-OS, Package Acceptance, and release-path Docker checks when soak runs. This keeps all package-facing boxes on the same bytes and avoids repeated package builds. After a beta is already on npm, set `release_package_spec=openclaw@YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N` so release checks download the shipped package once, extract its build source SHA from `dist/build-info.json`, and reuse that artifact for cross-OS, Package Acceptance, release-path Docker, and package Telegram lanes.

The cross-OS OpenAI install smoke uses `OPENCLAW_CROSS_OS_OPENAI_MODEL` when the repo/org variable is set, otherwise `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`, because this lane is proving package install, onboarding, gateway startup, and one live agent turn rather than benchmarking the most capable model. The broader live provider matrix remains the place for model-specific coverage.

Use these variants depending on release stage:

```bash
TOOLING_SHA="<recorded-full-main-ancestor-sha>"

# Validate the product-complete Code SHA; final notes let this also be Release SHA.
pnpm ci:full-release \
  --sha <code-sha> \
  --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"

# Optional: only after a later CHANGELOG-only edit, reuse the green Code proof.
pnpm ci:full-release \
  --sha <release-sha> \
  --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"

# Run postpublish confidence against the exact published beta.
pnpm ci:full-release \
  --sha <release-sha> \
  --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA" \
  -f release_package_spec=openclaw@YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N \
  -f evidence_package_spec=openclaw@YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N \
  -f run_release_soak=true \
  -f npm_telegram_provider_mode=mock-openai
```

Do not use the full umbrella as the first rerun after a focused fix. Classify the failure as product, harness/tooling/provenance, infrastructure/credential, or wrapper. Only confirmed product failure changes the Code SHA. Use one diagnosis, one fix when needed, and one narrow retry, then reassess. A narrow green run is evidence, not publish authorization by itself; there is no standalone parent finalizer.

`rerun_group=all` may reuse a prior green umbrella run when the release profile,
coverage policy, effective soak setting, and validation inputs match and either the target SHA
is identical or the new target is a descendant whose complete changed path set
is exactly `CHANGELOG.md`. Exact-target reuse records
`exact-target-full-validation-v1`; an optional CHANGELOG-only descendant records
`changelog-only-release-v1`. The latter reuses only product validation. Npm
preflight, package bytes, release-note provenance, and install/update acceptance
must still run against the Release SHA. Any version, source, generated,
dependency, package, or workflow-owned target change requires a new Code SHA
and fresh full validation. Concurrency is keyed by Validation SHA, Tooling SHA,
and rerun group and does not cancel prior runs. Parent cancellation leaves
adopted children running until the operator cancels the exact child. Pass
`reuse_evidence=false` only when a fresh full run is intentionally required.

For bounded recovery, pass `rerun_group` to the umbrella. Supported controller groups are `ci`, `plugin-prerelease`, `install-smoke`, `cross-os`, `live-e2e`, `package`, `qa-parity`, `qa-live`, `npm-telegram`, and `performance`; use `all` only for deliberate full validation. The removed `release-checks` aggregate handle is invalid because it silently selected every release-check lane and its package/Docker setup. `qa` remains available only as a direct `OpenClaw Release Checks` manual aggregate, not as an umbrella/controller retry API. Focused `npm-telegram` reruns require `release_package_spec` or `npm_telegram_package_spec`; all-group runs use Package Acceptance Telegram E2E except beta without soak, where it is deferred. Focused cross-OS reruns can add `cross_os_suite_filter=windows/packaged-upgrade` or another OS/suite filter. Live and QA-live filters are valid only with their owning group. Cross-OS filters also work with `rerun_group=all`: add `-f cross_os_suite_filter=ubuntu,macos` to exclude Windows. `npm-stable-v1` and `npm-beta-v1` qualification is preserved when all three Linux suites remain selected; omitted advisory lanes are not run, never passed. Mismatches fail before scheduling and never become an unfiltered broad run. QA release-check failures block normal release validation, including OpenClaw dynamic tool drift in the core runtime-pair lane. Tideclaw alpha runs may still treat non-package-safety release-check lanes as advisory. With `release_profile=beta`, the `Run repo/live E2E validation` live-provider suites are advisory (warnings, not blockers); stable and full profiles keep them blocking. When `live_suite_filter` explicitly requests a gated QA live lane such as Discord, WhatsApp, or Slack, the matching `OPENCLAW_RELEASE_QA_*_LIVE_CI_ENABLED` repo variable must be enabled; otherwise input capture fails instead of silently skipping the lane.

### Vitest

The Vitest box is the manual `CI` child workflow. Manual CI bypasses changed scoping and selects the normal test graph for the release candidate: Linux Node shards, bundled-plugin shards, plugin and channel contract shards, Node 24 minimum compatibility, `check-*`, `check-additional-*`, built-artifact smoke checks, docs checks, Python skills, Windows, macOS, and Control UI i18n. Under `npm-beta-v1`, the umbrella passes `release_scope=npm-beta` and `include_android=false`: native Swift/OpenClawKit, iOS, Android, and native i18n CI lanes are deferred; macOS and Windows Node checks remain. Other Full Release Validation runs use full CI with Android. Standalone manual CI defaults to full coverage and requires `include_android=true` for Android.

Use this box to answer "did the source tree pass the selected CI suite?" It is separate from release-path product validation. Evidence to keep:

- `Full Release Validation` summary showing the dispatched `CI` run URL
- `CI` run green on the exact target SHA
- recorded coverage policy and effective CI `release_scope`, including deferred native coverage
- failed or slow shard names from the CI jobs when investigating regressions
- Vitest timing artifacts such as `.artifacts/vitest-shard-timings.json` when a run needs performance analysis

Run manual CI directly only when the release needs deterministic normal CI but not the Docker, QA Lab, live, cross-OS, or package boxes. Use the first command for non-Android direct CI. Add `include_android=true` when direct release-candidate CI must cover Android:

```bash
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main -f target_ref=release/YYYY.M.PATCH
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main -f target_ref=release/YYYY.M.PATCH -f include_android=true
```

### Docker

The Docker box lives in `OpenClaw Release Checks` through `openclaw-live-and-e2e-checks-reusable.yml`, plus the release-mode `install-smoke` workflow. It validates the release candidate through packaged Docker environments instead of only source-level tests.

Release Docker coverage includes:

- full install smoke with the slow Bun global install smoke enabled
- root Dockerfile smoke image preparation/reuse by target SHA, with QR, root/gateway, and installer/Bun smoke jobs running as separate install-smoke shards
- repository E2E lanes
- release-path Docker chunks: `core`, `package-update-openai`, `package-update-onboarding`, `package-update-migrations`, `package-update-self-upgrade`, `plugins-runtime-plugins`, `plugins-runtime-services`, `plugins-runtime-install-a` through `plugins-runtime-install-h`, and `openwebui`
- OpenWebUI coverage on a dedicated large-disk runner when requested
- split bundled plugin install/uninstall lanes `bundled-plugin-install-uninstall-0` through `bundled-plugin-install-uninstall-23`
- live/E2E provider suites and Docker live model coverage when release checks include live suites

Use Docker artifacts before rerunning. The release-path scheduler uploads `.artifacts/docker-tests/` with lane logs, `summary.json`, `failures.json`, phase timings, scheduler plan JSON, and rerun commands. For focused recovery, use `docker_lanes=<lane[,lane]>` on the reusable live/E2E workflow instead of rerunning all release chunks. Generated rerun commands include prior `package_artifact_run_id` and prepared Docker image inputs when available, so a failed lane can reuse the same tarball and GHCR images.

### QA Lab

The QA Lab box is also part of `OpenClaw Release Checks`. It is the agentic behavior and channel-level release gate, separate from Vitest and Docker package mechanics.

Release QA Lab coverage includes:

- mock parity lane comparing the OpenAI candidate lane against the `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` baseline using the agentic parity pack
- Matrix live-adapter catalog lane using the `qa-live-shared` environment
- live Telegram QA lane using Convex CI credential leases
- `pnpm qa:otel:smoke`, `pnpm qa:otel:collector-smoke`, `pnpm qa:prometheus:smoke`, or `pnpm qa:observability:smoke` when release telemetry needs explicit local proof

Use this box to answer "does the release behave correctly in QA scenarios and live channel flows?" Keep the artifact URLs for parity, Matrix, and Telegram lanes when approving the release. Matrix runs use the same catalog-derived sharded selection in scheduled, manual, and release workflows.

### Package

The Package box is the installable-product gate. It is backed by `Package Acceptance` and the resolver `scripts/resolve-openclaw-package-candidate.mts`. The resolver normalizes a candidate into the `package-under-test` tarball consumed by Docker E2E, validates the package inventory, records the package version and SHA-256, and keeps the workflow harness ref separate from the package source ref.

Supported candidate sources:

- `source=npm`: `openclaw@beta`, `openclaw@latest`, or an exact OpenClaw release version
- `source=ref`: pack a trusted `package_ref` branch, tag, or full commit SHA with the selected `workflow_ref` harness
- `source=url`: download a public HTTPS `.tgz` with required `package_sha256`; URL credentials, non-default HTTPS ports, private/internal/special-use hostnames or resolved addresses, and unsafe redirects are rejected
- `source=trusted-url`: download an HTTPS `.tgz` with required `package_sha256` and `trusted_source_id` from a named policy in `.github/package-trusted-sources.json`; use this for maintainer-owned enterprise mirrors or private package repositories instead of adding an input-level private-network bypass to `source=url`
- `source=artifact`: reuse a `.tgz` uploaded by another GitHub Actions run

`OpenClaw Release Checks` runs Package Acceptance with `source=artifact`, the prepared release package artifact, `suite_profile=custom`, and `docker_lanes=release-typed-onboarding doctor-switch update-channel-switch skill-install update-corrupt-plugin upgrade-survivor published-upgrade-survivor root-managed-vps-upgrade update-restart-auth plugins-offline plugin-update plugin-binding-command-escape`. This retains typed onboarding, migration, update, root-managed VPS upgrade, configured-auth update restart, live ClawHub skill install, stale plugin dependency cleanup, offline plugin fixtures, plugin update, and plugin command-binding escape hardening against the same resolved tarball. Telegram uses `telegram_mode=none` for beta `all` without soak; explicit `package` and soak-enabled runs select `mock-openai` by default. Blocking release checks use the default latest published package baseline. Soak resolves the latest stable baseline once and adds the `reported-issues` scenarios; broad historical migration remains a separate manual workflow. Use Package Acceptance with `source=npm` for an already shipped candidate, `source=ref` for a SHA-backed local npm tarball before publish, `source=trusted-url` for a maintainer-owned enterprise/private mirror, or `source=artifact` for a prepared tarball uploaded by another GitHub Actions run.

It is the GitHub-native replacement for most of the package/update coverage that previously required Parallels. Cross-OS release checks still matter for OS-specific onboarding, installer, and platform behavior, but package/update product validation should prefer Package Acceptance.

The canonical checklist for update and plugin validation is [Testing updates and plugins](/help/testing-updates-plugins). Use it when deciding which local, Docker, Package Acceptance, or release-check lane proves a plugin install/update, doctor cleanup, or published-package migration change. Exhaustive published update migration from every stable `2026.4.23+` package is a separate manual `Update Migration` workflow, not part of Full Release CI.

Legacy package-acceptance leniency is intentionally time boxed. Packages through `2026.4.25` may use the compatibility path for metadata gaps already published to npm: private QA inventory entries missing from the tarball, missing `gateway install --wrapper`, missing patch files in the tarball-derived git fixture, missing persisted `update.channel`, legacy plugin install-record locations, missing marketplace install-record persistence, and config metadata migration during `plugins update`. The published `2026.4.26` package may warn for local build metadata stamp files that were already shipped. Later packages must satisfy the modern package contracts; those same gaps fail release validation.

Use broader Package Acceptance profiles when the release question is about an actual installable package:

```bash
gh workflow run package-acceptance.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f workflow_ref=main \
  -f source=npm \
  -f package_spec=openclaw@beta \
  -f suite_profile=product \
  -f published_upgrade_survivor_baseline=openclaw@2026.4.26
```

Common package profiles:

- `smoke`: quick package install/channel/agent, gateway network, and config reload lanes
- `package`: install/update/restart/plugin package contracts plus live ClawHub skill install proof; this is the release-check default
- `product`: `package` plus MCP channels, cron/subagent cleanup, OpenAI web search, and OpenWebUI
- `full`: Docker release-path chunks with OpenWebUI
- `custom`: exact `docker_lanes` list for focused reruns

For package-candidate Telegram proof, enable `telegram_mode=mock-openai` or `telegram_mode=live-frontier` on Package Acceptance. The workflow passes the resolved `package-under-test` tarball into the Telegram lane; the standalone Telegram workflow still accepts a published npm spec for post-publish checks.

## Regular release publish automation

### Prepare once, then use the release button

For a complete regular beta or stable release, use `OpenClaw Release Prepare`
before publication and `OpenClaw Release Button` when ready to publish. Both run
from the same frozen `release-publish/<sha12>-<id>` tooling tag. The existing
release tag, successful npm preflight, exact Full Release Validation attempt,
reviewed SDK acknowledgement when required, and stable Windows source evidence
must already be available. This does not create a version or release tag.

Run `pnpm release:candidate` with `--publish-workflow-ref` set to that protected
tag. Its evidence bundle and terminal output include a **prepare once** command
for complete regular releases. After creating the frozen release tag, run that
command. It dispatches the existing npm and ClawHub preflight workflows in
parallel, builds and qualifies their final package bytes, and seals a readiness
receipt only after every package can be downloaded and verified. Preparation
does not publish packages or change public selectors.

Every ClawHub package must already have the normal trusted-publisher binding.
Preparation refuses to issue a readiness receipt for packages needing bootstrap
or publisher repair; use the existing ClawHub owner workflow to finish that setup
first. The button rechecks this prerequisite before starting any plugin writer.

When preparation succeeds, copy its summary's `prepared_artifact` JSON into
**OpenClaw Release Button**, selecting the same protected tooling tag. This is
the only input needed for a new publication: the receipt contains the release tag,
channel, validation references, complete package inventories, and exact artifact
IDs, digests, producer runs and attempts. The button invokes the existing
protected publisher; existing environment approvals and registry authority
checks remain in force. The receipt seals plugin readiness; the existing parent
revalidates the core npm, Full Release Validation, and Windows evidence before
dispatching publication.

The publisher verifies the complete prepared npm and ClawHub package set before
starting any plugin writer. Plugin jobs restore and upload those exact bytes;
they do not install source dependencies, rebuild, or repack them. Packages that
are already present must match the prepared integrity and canonical public
tarball before they can be adopted. Core npm and Docker retain their existing
prepared-artifact and release-evidence checks. Because ClawHub's publication
authorization depends on terminal parent success, the outer button waits for
the publisher and then verifies ClawHub's canonical public downloads. Only then
does it make the GitHub draft release visible.

Optional stable Windows promotion starts after that outer activation, using the
same sealed source tag, installer digests, and protected tooling. The ordinary
unprepared publisher retains its own post-finalization Windows job; the two
routes do not both dispatch. Missing Windows selection skips promotion, an
incomplete selection fails visibly, and alpha/beta never dispatch it. Windows
failure does not undo npm or GitHub publication. Inspect the attempt-bound
Windows dispatch artifact and linked child before an explicit manual retry;
neither publisher waits for native completion.

This button covers core and plugin npm, ClawHub, the existing Docker/Windows
contracts, and GitHub release visibility. It does **not** claim that independent
macOS signing/feed promotion, Android completion, app-store submission, or
website publication is ready. Those owners retain their existing release steps.
Alpha, extended-stable, selected-plugin repairs, and historical releases without
a readiness receipt continue to use their existing owner workflows.

### Recover a failed download

Transient network failures, interrupted responses, HTTP 408/429, and retryable server
errors receive bounded retries with backoff and `Retry-After` handling. Each
retry requests the original artifact ID again, obtaining a fresh signed URL.
Transfers have a shared deadline; permanent authentication/not-found failures,
identity drift, and digest/size mismatches stop instead of selecting another
artifact. Complete verified ZIPs can be reused within the same runner, but only
after fresh producer checks and a fresh local hash. An interrupted file restarts;
this does not assume GitHub supports byte-range resumption. A new runner may
download the same immutable bytes again.

Preparation retains `request.json` before its first dispatch and after each
acknowledgement. A `null` child ID means **unconfirmed**, not that no run exists.
After inspecting Actions, fill both `npmRunId` and `clawhubRunId` with the exact
positive numeric child IDs. Start a new **OpenClaw Release Prepare** run on the
same protected tooling tag with the same `publish_inputs` and this JSON as
`preparation_request`. It adopts those runs without dispatching any workflow;
the seal still verifies their source, tooling, complete rosters, and package bytes.
If a child never existed, start only that missing owner: **Plugin NPM Release**
with `preflight_only=true` and `trusted_publisher_preflight=false`, or **Plugin
ClawHub Release** with `dry_run=true`. Use the same protected tooling tag, exact
source SHA as `ref`, and `publish_scope=all-publishable`, then supply both IDs.
Never repeat an uncertain dispatch. This JSON is an explicit selection of runs
to qualify, not cryptographic proof of original dispatch lineage.

Publication similarly creates `dispatch.json` before its single POST. It records
the initiating button run/attempt, complete effective inputs (including any core
resume override), frozen source/tooling, and exact readiness descriptor.
`state: "unknown"` has no confirmed publisher. `state: "unverified"` retains a
returned publisher ID but no observed attempt; `expectedReleaseRunAttempt: 1`
is only an expectation. Only `state: "acknowledged"` records a freshly checked
publisher identity and observed attempt. The record is retained before summaries
or job outputs; an interrupted atomic update can also leave `dispatch.next.json`.
Inspect both files without treating the latter as automatic publication authority.

The `release-button-dispatch-<button-run>-<attempt>` artifact retains these named
files for **30 days**. Download and preserve the original artifact for recovery.
Upload/download failure or expiration means missing evidence, not permission to
create a replacement publisher. The CLI reports the request path, initiating
attempt, and known publisher ID. For an acknowledged request, verification is
read-only and can be repeated with the same protected tooling:

```bash
node scripts/openclaw-release-ready.mjs verify --request /path/to/dispatch.json
```

Unknown, unverified, unsupported, or inconsistent requests stop before verification
or activation: **unknown; do not redispatch**. Manually reconcile the original
button and publisher outcomes. Do not discover or adopt a latest run/attempt, edit
an uncertain record into a success receipt, or rerun the dispatch job. Even a
missing record cannot prove that publication did not happen.

| Failure                                                                   | Recovery                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| The button's final ClawHub readback fails after an upload                 | Treat publication as possibly visible and verification as pending. Rerun the button's failed verification job; its successful dispatch job is not repeated.                                 |
| A publisher itself partially fails                                        | Inspect the original publisher and its core child. Recover through a new button run, supplying `openclaw_npm_resume_run_id` when core npm is already published, as described below.         |
| Artifact expired/deleted or integrity differs                             | Stop and reconcile any publication attempt before explicitly preparing a new receipt. Missing evidence never authorizes a replacement publisher; never silently use a newer successful run. |
| Publication dispatch response is lost                                     | Preserve `dispatch.json` and any `dispatch.next.json`, inspect the initiating button and original publisher outcomes, and stop for manual reconciliation. Never automatically redispatch.   |

Use **Re-run failed jobs**, not **Re-run all jobs**, after the button has
dispatched publication. Its dispatch job refuses a second attempt; verification
and final visibility can be retried independently without another registry
upload. Separate button runs are still separate operator publication requests,
not a global exactly-once transaction across registries.

A parent workflow attempt and its child receipts are one authorization unit.
The button never substitutes a newer parent attempt for its recorded dispatch.
For prepared publication recovery, start a **new button run** with the same
`prepared_artifact` and protected tooling tag. If core npm is already published,
set the optional `openclaw_npm_resume_run_id` to its **successful original
OpenClaw NPM Release child**. If npm contains the core version but that child
failed, stop and preserve the original run and artifact evidence. The existing
core owner rejects republishing an existing version and requires a successful
child for resume; this case needs maintainer reconciliation/core-owner repair,
not a button retry. All other frozen inputs and prepared artifacts remain unchanged.
The new button records its new recovery parent, waits for that exact attempt to
succeed, verifies canonical ClawHub downloads, and then activates the GitHub
release. Do not adopt a replacement parent into the original button or bypass
this path with a manual finalizer.

A rerun child preparation must seal the complete package set from successful
pack/preflight jobs in that same attempt. Reusing previous-attempt jobs or
rerunning only the child's seal is rejected; rerun all jobs in that
non-publishing child, then rerun only the outer seal.

### Direct publication and owner recovery

For beta, `latest`, plugin, GitHub Release, and platform publication,
`OpenClaw Release Publish` remains the protected mutating owner. The monthly
`.33+` Gateway extended-stable path does not use this orchestrator. The
regular workflow orchestrates the trusted-publisher workflows in the order the
release needs. Linux cross-OS validation remains blocking; Windows/macOS
cross-OS conclusions are advisory and cannot block the saved validation
evidence. macOS app signing, notarization, appcast updates, and Windows Hub asset
promotion can run in parallel with or after npm publication and never delay
npm. Their artifact contracts still govern platform readiness and GitHub
release closeout. Full Release Validation and qualified package artifacts must already be green; no app artifact is a prerequisite:

1. Check out the release tag and resolve its commit SHA.
2. Verify the tag is reachable from `main` or `release/*` (or a Tideclaw alpha branch for alpha prereleases).
3. Run `pnpm plugins:sync:check`.
4. Dispatch `Plugin NPM Release` with `publish_scope=all-publishable` and `ref=<release-sha>`.
5. Dispatch `Plugin ClawHub Release` with the same scope and SHA.
6. After plugin npm succeeds, dispatch `OpenClaw NPM Release` with the release tag, npm dist-tag, and saved `preflight_run_id` after verifying the saved `full_release_validation_run_id` and exact run attempt. ClawHub proceeds in parallel.
7. Verify the published npm package and selector readback, then call reusable `Docker Release` with the immutable tag and SHA. Finalize the draft GitHub release after npm and Docker evidence succeeds; Docker remains part of the Gateway distribution.
8. For stable, optionally dispatch `Windows Node Release` after finalization with both `windows_node_tag` and candidate-approved `windows_node_installer_digests`. It attaches signed installers and checksums to the public release as a detached child. Omit both inputs to skip Windows dispatch. When the tagged `apps/android/version.json` matches the release train, qualify and dispatch `Android Release` independently for its exact-tag signed APK, checksum, and provenance; run macOS validation/preflight/publish through `openclaw/releases` in parallel or afterward. No app workflow delays npm or GitHub release finalization. Track app failures through their summaries and evidence, then recover only the failed platform.

The Android train is pinned independently. If its tagged version differs from
the stable tag's base version, the parent skips both native qualification and
APK publication and records the pin, expected train, and remedy in its summary
and release proof. Before the next tag, prepare the shared mobile release with
`node --import tsx scripts/mobile-release-version.ts --prepare --version YYYY.M.PATCH --write`.
When preparing the core and mobile release together, use
`pnpm release:prepare --version YYYY.M.PATCH --android --write`; its Android
selection uses the same shared mobile preparation and reads pending notes from
`apps/ios/CHANGELOG.md`. The generated Android notes must fit
[Google Play's 500 Unicode character limit](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859348),
including the final newline. iOS App Store finalization remains a separate step.
A matching pin still requires successful native qualification; a failed run is
never recorded as a pin mismatch skip.

Android approval binds the release tag and target SHA to the approving parent's
run ID, exact attempt, full ref, and workflow SHA. npm-stable publication adds the
native CI run, exact attempt, and tooling ref in a v3 receipt; full validation
retains the historical v2 receipt. The child verifies the attested receipt and
the live parent identity, including the protected tooling tag or main ancestry.
Normal Android admission accepts an active or successfully completed
parent and the exact stable target release, whether draft or public. Failed or
cancelled parents remain rejected; explicit recovery can separately admit a
completed failed parent. Before provenance publication and each asset upload,
Android rechecks the live release tag target and stable classification, protected
tooling identity, native CI qualification when present, and exact parent attempt/state.
The parent also rechecks native qualification immediately before dispatch.
These are fresh boundary checks,
not an atomic GitHub validation-and-write transaction. A dispatched run link is
pending publication evidence, not an APK download claim. Monitor and approve the
linked Android run separately;
if dispatch cannot be confirmed, inspect existing runs before retrying.
For explicit Android recovery, pass `release_publish_run_attempt`,
`release_publish_full_ref`, and `release_publish_workflow_sha` from that same
parent alongside its run ID and ref; a rerun requires its own matching receipt.
Older immutable release tags retain their original Android workflow contract.
Tags without the v3 consumer, including `v2026.8.2` and its same-source corrections,
require `release_profile=full` and their matching frozen release tooling;
npm-only qualification is rejected before core publication for those targets.

For real core npm, plugin npm, or ClawHub publication, run the parent from a
protected lightweight `release-publish/<sha12>-<epoch>` tag at the frozen Tooling
SHA. Parent and child provenance must carry that same full ref. Create and push
the tooling tag before running the publish command:

```bash
TOOLING_SHA="<recorded-full-tooling-sha>"
PUBLISH_REF="release-publish/$(printf '%s' "$TOOLING_SHA" | cut -c1-12)-$(date +%s)"
git tag "$PUBLISH_REF" "$TOOLING_SHA"
git push origin "refs/tags/$PUBLISH_REF"
```

Pass `--ref "$PUBLISH_REF"` to `gh workflow run`; real child publication from
`main` is rejected before work starts. Docker-only recovery may use `main`;
the matching Tideclaw alpha branch route is unchanged.

Beta publish example (using the tooling tag above):

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-release-publish.yml \
  --ref "$PUBLISH_REF" \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N \
  -f preflight_run_id=<successful-openclaw-npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<successful-full-release-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<successful-full-release-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f plugin_sdk_api_acknowledgement=<reviewed-8-character-digest> \
  -f npm_dist_tag=beta
```

Include `plugin_sdk_api_acknowledgement` only when the npm preflight's Plugin SDK API report contains changes.

If a beta or regular stable package is already published but its container images are missing,
do not rerun npm or plugin publication. Reuse the immutable release tag plus its
successful npm preflight and Full Release Validation evidence through the
Docker-only recovery path. The workflow rechecks the exact npm version, the
selected npm dist-tag, and the published tarball digest before building containers:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-release-publish.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N \
  -f preflight_run_id=<successful-openclaw-npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<successful-full-release-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<successful-full-release-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f npm_dist_tag=beta \
  -f publish_openclaw_npm=false \
  -f publish_docker_only=true
```

For regular stable recovery, use the same command with `tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH` and
`npm_dist_tag=latest`. Only regular stable tags (patches 1–32, including correction
suffixes) are accepted for `latest`; extended-stable recovery retains its own
selector. Recovery builds the canonical versioned images without republishing
npm packages or plugins, dispatching native releases, or finalizing the GitHub
release. Existing approval and provenance checks still apply.

Stable publish to the default beta dist-tag:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-release-publish.yml \
  --ref "$PUBLISH_REF" \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH \
  -f preflight_run_id=<successful-openclaw-npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<successful-full-release-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<successful-full-release-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f plugin_sdk_api_acknowledgement=<reviewed-8-character-digest> \
  -f npm_dist_tag=beta
```

Both Windows inputs are optional. To schedule detached promotion after GitHub publication, add `windows_node_tag` and `windows_node_installer_digests` together; the candidate helper records the digest map when given `--windows-node-tag`.

To attach Windows assets later or retry a failed promotion, use the exact OpenClaw tag, exact published Windows source tag, and approved installer digests:

```bash
gh workflow run windows-node-release.yml \
  --repo openclaw/openclaw \
  --ref main \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH \
  -f windows_node_tag=vX.Y.Z \
  -f expected_installer_digests='{"OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe":"sha256:<approved-x64-sha256>","OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe":"sha256:<approved-arm64-sha256>"}'
```

Never substitute `latest` for either tag. Monitor the Windows run and its verification evidence separately; an unsuccessful promotion leaves the npm package and GitHub release published. macOS recovery uses `openclaw/releases/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-validate.yml` and `openclaw-macos-publish.yml`, preserving the successful macOS preflight and validation run IDs when promoting prepared assets.

Stable promotion directly to `latest` is explicit:

```bash
gh workflow run openclaw-release-publish.yml \
  --ref "$PUBLISH_REF" \
  -f tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH \
  -f preflight_run_id=<successful-openclaw-npm-preflight-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_id=<successful-full-release-validation-run-id> \
  -f full_release_validation_run_attempt=<successful-full-release-validation-run-attempt> \
  -f plugin_sdk_api_acknowledgement=<reviewed-8-character-digest> \
  -f npm_dist_tag=latest
```

For a selected plugin repair, use `OpenClaw Release Publish` with `publish_openclaw_npm=false`, `plugin_publish_scope=selected`, and `plugins=@openclaw/name`. The parent rejects selected scope when `publish_openclaw_npm=true` so the core package cannot ship without every publishable official plugin, including `@openclaw/diffs-language-pack`. `Plugin NPM Release` also supports direct focused repair dispatch.

Plugin npm artifact preflight checks out only the trusted scripts and workflows
it needs. Preflight and publication fetch the selected source manifest on demand
at the exact release SHA. Each verifier still independently checks that manifest
against the artifact's recorded source hash, together with the tarball hashes
and producer identity.

ClawHub OIDC publication requires the executing release parent to authorize the exact child run, attempt, and package inventories. A direct `Plugin ClawHub Release` dry run can prepare packages without publication authority, but a standalone publish cannot replace the parent. Bot-dispatched children stay on the automated route and are terminal once their exact parent attempt completes without success.

A direct human `Plugin ClawHub Release` dispatch with `release_publish_run_id` always takes ClawHub's explicit-recovery route. The `approve_plugins_clawhub_release` environment job uploads the version 2 `openclaw-clawhub-recovery-approval-<run-id>-<run-attempt>` receipt, which names the original child attempt (`authorizedChildRunId`/`authorizedChildRunAttempt`) whose parent receipt `openclaw-clawhub-parent-authorization-v2-<parent-run-id>-<parent-run-attempt>-<child-run-id>-<child-run-attempt>` the completed parent already uploaded; a completed parent cannot mint a new one. ClawHub resolves that parent receipt through the authorized child and requires the recovery child to run the same workflow ref and SHA, candidate SHA, tooling, parent attempt, and exact package inventory, so dispatch recovery from the parent's tooling ref with the parent's inputs. Pass `recovered_clawhub_run_id` and `recovered_clawhub_run_attempt` to name the original child explicitly; when omitted, the approval job discovers it from the parent run's single matching receipt and fails with the candidate list when zero or several exist. Version 1 recovery receipts are rejected. Do not retry publication with copied receipts or treat staging as completed publication.

```bash
gh workflow run plugin-clawhub-release.yml \
  --ref <parent-tooling-ref> \
  -f publish_scope=all-publishable \
  -f ref=<full-40-character-release-sha> \
  -f release_tag=vYYYY.M.PATCH \
  -f release_publish_run_id=<parent-run-id> \
  -f release_publish_run_attempt=<parent-run-attempt> \
  -f release_publish_branch=<parent-tooling-ref> \
  -f release_publish_full_ref=<parent-tooling-full-ref> \
  -f release_publish_workflow_sha=<parent-tooling-sha> \
  -f recovered_clawhub_run_id=<original-child-run-id> \
  -f recovered_clawhub_run_attempt=<original-child-run-attempt>
```

Before dispatching a ClawHub publisher, the parent refuses dispatch if a run for
the same tooling ref is waiting, pending, queued, or in progress. Follow the
reported run URL: wait for active publication, or reject a stale run's pending
deployment through GitHub's [pending-deployments API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#review-pending-deployments-for-a-workflow-run)
with `state=rejected` before retrying.
The parent does not automatically reject or cancel detached children.

For pre-tag ClawHub bootstrap validation, dispatch `Plugin ClawHub New` from
trusted `main` and pass the full target release SHA through `ref`. Tagged
bootstrap is dispatched by the approved parent from its protected tooling tag;
Tideclaw alpha uses separately approved `main` tooling. Never dispatch bootstrap
from the product release tag or a release branch:

```bash
gh workflow run plugin-clawhub-new.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f plugins=@openclaw/name \
  -f ref=<full-40-character-release-sha> \
  -f pretag_validation=true \
  -f dry_run=true
```

Pre-tag validation requires `dry_run=true`, rejects release-tag and parent-run
inputs, and accepts only an exact target reachable from `main` or `release/*`.
It does not load ClawHub credentials, publish package bytes, or change trusted
publisher configuration. The workflow still resolves the live registry plan,
checks out and packs the target only in a secretless job, materializes the
locked ClawHub toolchain, and validates the immutable artifact and package
slug/identity before the release tag exists. Approve the
`clawhub-plugin-bootstrap` environment only after the secretless pack jobs
finish; this protected validation job has no credentials or mutation commands.

An approved dry run or real bootstrap after tagging must include the exact
release tag plus the parent `OpenClaw Release Publish` run id, attempt, and
ref. The parent attests the bootstrap workflow ref and exact SHA, using its
protected tooling tag for regular publication or separately approved `main`
tooling for Tideclaw alpha; the child run and every protected environment
approval must match that approved child SHA. The release tag is
rechecked before every publish attempt and trusted-publisher mutation.

The pack job
uploads one immutable artifact whose name, Actions artifact ID/digest,
producer run/attempt, target SHA, and per-package tarball SHA-256/size are
carried into the validation and protected jobs. The protected job checks out the parent-approved trusted
tooling, validates the artifact tuple through the GitHub API, downloads
by exact artifact ID, rehashes every tarball, and validates local TAR paths and
package identity with the pinned CLI's USTAR canonicalization rules. Every
candidate then passes the pinned CLI publish dry-run, which returns before
registry lookup or auth. The credential-job prefilter caps compressed ClawPacks
at 120 MiB, total file payload at 50 MiB, expanded TAR data at 64 MiB, and
TAR entry count at 10,000. Existing-package trusted-publisher repair remains
configure-only, but it still packs the target and requires the requested tag
plus exact registry byte and metadata equality before changing trusted-publisher
configuration. Post-publish verification downloads the ClawHub artifact and
requires the same SHA-256 and size. A rerun-failed recovery may reuse an earlier
attempt's package artifact only when the exact producer job completed
successfully. Final evidence also binds the locked ClawHub version, lock
SHA-256, and npm integrity. A mismatch requires a new package version.

## NPM workflow inputs

`OpenClaw NPM Release` accepts these operator-controlled inputs:

- `tag`: required release tag such as `v2026.4.2`, `v2026.4.2-1`, `v2026.4.2-beta.1`, or `v2026.4.2-alpha.1`; when `preflight_only=true`, it may also be the current full 40-character workflow-branch commit SHA for validation-only preflight
- `preflight_only`: `true` for validation/build/package only, `false` for the real publish path
- `preflight_run_id`: existing successful preflight run id, required on the real publish path so the workflow reuses the prepared tarball instead of rebuilding it
- `full_release_validation_run_id`: successful `Full Release Validation` run id for this tag/SHA, required for real publish. Beta publishes may proceed on preflight alone with a warning, but stable/`latest` promotion still requires it.
- `full_release_validation_run_attempt`: exact positive run attempt paired with `full_release_validation_run_id`; required whenever the run id is provided so reruns cannot change the authorization evidence during publish.
- `release_publish_run_id`: approved `OpenClaw Release Publish` run id; required when this workflow is dispatched by that parent (bot-actor real-publish calls)
- `plugin_npm_run_id`: successful exact-head `Plugin NPM Release` run id; required for a real `extended-stable` core publish
- `npm_dist_tag`: npm target tag for the publish path; accepts `alpha`, `beta`, `latest`, or `extended-stable` and defaults to `beta`. Final patch `33` and later must use `extended-stable`; by default, `extended-stable` rejects earlier patches, and it always rejects non-final tags.
- `bypass_extended_stable_guard`: testing-only boolean, default `false`; with `npm_dist_tag=extended-stable`, bypasses monthly extended-stable eligibility while preserving release identity, artifact, approval, and readback checks.

`Plugin NPM Release` accepts `npm_dist_tag=default` for existing release
behavior or `npm_dist_tag=extended-stable` for the guarded monthly path. The
extended-stable option requires `publish_scope=all-publishable`, an empty
`plugins` input, a final patch at or above `33`, and the canonical
`extended-stable/YYYY.M.33` branch at its exact tip. It never moves plugin
`latest` or `beta`. New package versions receive `extended-stable` atomically
through OIDC trusted publication (`npm publish --tag extended-stable`); this
source workflow does not use token-authenticated `npm dist-tag add`. Retries
skip exact versions already present in npm, then fail closed unless complete
readback confirms that every exact package and `extended-stable` tag converged.

`OpenClaw Release Publish` accepts these operator-controlled inputs:

- `tag`: required release tag; must already exist
- `preflight_run_id`: successful `OpenClaw NPM Release` preflight run id; required when `publish_openclaw_npm=true` or `plugin_publish_scope=all-publishable`
- `full_release_validation_run_id`: successful `Full Release Validation` run id; required when `publish_openclaw_npm=true` or `plugin_publish_scope=all-publishable`
- `full_release_validation_run_attempt`: exact positive attempt paired with `full_release_validation_run_id`; required whenever the run id is provided
- `windows_node_tag`: optional exact non-prerelease `openclaw/openclaw-windows-node` release tag for detached Windows promotion after stable GitHub publication; omit both Windows inputs to skip dispatch
- `windows_node_installer_digests`: candidate-approved compact JSON map of the current Windows installer names to pinned `sha256:` digests; required only when `windows_node_tag` is supplied
- `npm_telegram_run_id`: optional successful `NPM Telegram Beta E2E` run id to include in final release evidence
- `npm_dist_tag`: npm target tag for the OpenClaw package, one of `alpha`, `beta`, `latest`, or `extended-stable`
- `publish_docker_only`: beta, regular stable (`latest`), or extended-stable recovery/closeout path. It requires `publish_openclaw_npm=false`, complete preflight and Full Release Validation evidence, then verifies the exact npm package, selected dist-tag, and tarball digest before invoking Docker publication.
- `plugin_publish_scope`: defaults to `all-publishable`; use `selected` only for focused plugin-only repair work with `publish_openclaw_npm=false`
- `plugins`: comma-separated `@openclaw/*` package names when `plugin_publish_scope=selected`
- `publish_openclaw_npm`: defaults to `true`; set `false` only when using the workflow as a plugin-only repair orchestrator
- `release_profile`: release coverage profile used for release evidence summaries; defaults to `from-validation`, which reads it from the validation manifest, or override with `beta`, `stable`, or `full`
- `wait_for_clawhub`: defaults to `false`; set `true` when parent workflow completion must include ClawHub completion. Core npm starts after plugin npm succeeds under either setting.

`OpenClaw Release Checks` accepts these operator-controlled inputs:

- `ref`: branch, tag, or full commit SHA to validate. Secret-bearing checks require the resolved commit to be reachable from an OpenClaw branch or release tag.
- `run_release_soak`: opt into exhaustive live/E2E, Docker release-path, and reported-issue upgrade-survivor soak for beta release checks. It is forced on by `release_profile=stable` and `release_profile=full`.

Rules:

- Regular final and correction versions below patch `33` may publish to either `beta` or `latest`. Final versions at patch `33` or above must publish to `extended-stable`, and correction-suffix versions at that boundary are rejected.
- Beta prerelease tags may publish only to `beta`; alpha prerelease tags may publish only to `alpha`
- For `OpenClaw NPM Release`, full commit SHA input is allowed only when `preflight_only=true`
- `OpenClaw Release Checks` and `Full Release Validation` are always validation-only
- The real publish path must use the same `npm_dist_tag` used during preflight; the workflow verifies that metadata before publish continues

## Regular beta/latest stable release sequence

This legacy sequence is for the regular orchestrated release that also owns plugins, GitHub Release, Windows, and other platform work. It is not the monthly `.33+` Gateway extended-stable path documented at the top of this page.

When cutting a regular orchestrated stable release:

1. Run `OpenClaw NPM Release` with `preflight_only=true`. Before a tag exists, you may use the current full workflow-branch commit SHA for a validation-only dry run of the preflight workflow.
2. Choose `npm_dist_tag=beta` for the normal beta-first flow, or `latest` only when you intentionally want a direct stable publish.
3. Run `Full Release Validation` on the release branch, release tag, or full commit SHA when you want normal CI plus live prompt cache, Docker, QA Lab, Matrix, and Telegram coverage from one manual workflow. If you intentionally only need the deterministic normal test graph, run the manual `CI` workflow on the release ref instead.
4. Optionally select the exact non-prerelease `openclaw/openclaw-windows-node` release tag whose signed x64 and ARM64 installers should attach after publication. Save it as `windows_node_tag`, with the validated `windows_node_installer_digests` map. The release-candidate helper records both when given `--windows-node-tag`; omit the option if Windows is not ready.
5. Save the successful `preflight_run_id`, `full_release_validation_run_id`, and exact `full_release_validation_run_attempt`.
6. Run `OpenClaw Release Publish` from the protected `release-publish/<sha12>-<epoch>` tooling tag with the same `tag`, the same `npm_dist_tag`, the optional Windows input pair, the saved `preflight_run_id`, `full_release_validation_run_id`, and `full_release_validation_run_attempt`. It starts plugin npm and ClawHub in parallel, then promotes the prepared OpenClaw npm package once plugin npm succeeds. GitHub finalization waits for npm and Docker evidence; apps attach independently afterward.
7. If the release landed on `beta`, use the `openclaw/releases/.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-dist-tags.yml` workflow to promote that stable version from `beta` to `latest`.
8. Immediately after publishing or promoting to `latest`, manually dispatch that same release-ledger workflow to repair the beta floor. Every package's `beta` must be at least its own `latest`; preserve a newer beta. The daily scheduled repair is only a backstop, not a substitute for this release step.

The release ledger owns npm dist-tag promotion and repair because those operations require `NPM_TOKEN`, while the source repo keeps OIDC-only publish. Post-publication verification reads npm dist-tags through the exact release version and fails when core or an official plugin in the release selection has a missing beta or a beta older than latest, listing the affected packages and observed tags.

Until the release-ledger workflow covers official plugin packages, stale plugin beta tags intentionally block verification and require manual operator repair. For each listed stale package, run `npm dist-tag add <pkg>@<latest> beta`, substituting that package's name and current `latest` version. Preserve any newer beta tag. This manual recovery is required even if the core-only ledger repair succeeds; rerun verification before completing the release.

If a maintainer must fall back to local npm authentication, run any 1Password CLI (`op`) commands only inside a dedicated tmux session. Do not call `op` directly from the main agent shell; keeping it inside tmux makes prompts, alerts, and OTP handling observable and prevents repeated host alerts.

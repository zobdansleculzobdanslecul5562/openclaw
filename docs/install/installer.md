OpenClaw ships three installer scripts, served from `openclaw.ai`.

| Script                             | Platform             | What it does                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`install.sh`](#installsh)         | macOS / Linux / WSL  | Installs Node if needed, installs OpenClaw via npm (default) or git, can run onboarding.       |
| [`install-cli.sh`](#install-clish) | macOS / Linux / WSL  | Installs Node + OpenClaw into a local prefix (`~/.openclaw`) via npm or git. No root required. |
| [`install.ps1`](#installps1)       | Windows (PowerShell) | Installs Node if needed, installs OpenClaw via npm (default) or git, can run onboarding.       |

All three support Node **24.16+ or 26.1+** with a WAL-reset-safe linked SQLite library. When Node is missing, `install.sh` provisions Node 26 through Homebrew on macOS and the supported Node 24 LTS line through NodeSource on Linux. When a supported RPM-owned Node links unsafe SQLite, `install.sh` preserves the distro package and provisions a user-space Node runtime through `install-cli.sh`. The rootless `install-cli.sh` downloads Node 24.19.0; Linux ARMv7 is unsupported. On Windows, winget/Chocolatey/Scoop install the supported Node LTS line, and the portable fallback downloads Node 26.

Before changing packages, every installer probes the exact npm executable it will use. npm 11.15 and earlier installs normally; npm 11.16 and later, including npm 12, receives `--allow-scripts` for only the npm-resolved OpenClaw candidate identity. An unreadable npm version stops before package mutation. A remaining `.openclaw-lifecycle-pending` marker or legacy `dist/openclaw-install-guard` makes the install fail instead of reporting a lifecycle-skipped package as successful.

On npm 12, local `.tgz` and `.tar.gz` installs and updates need a comma-free archive filename and parent path. npm uses commas to separate lifecycle approvals, so move the archive to a comma-free path before retrying. Relative tarball arguments are still supported; the installer resolves their full path for approval.

Install-method switches verify the replacement before retiring the current owner. Source wrappers use a same-directory atomic replacement; when an npm shim shares that path, the installer moves only an identity-matched source wrapper aside and restores it if npm installation, lifecycle checks, or candidate verification fails. On upgrades, `install.sh` and `install.ps1` run `openclaw doctor --fix`; repair or final verification failure exits nonzero, and the success banner appears only after those steps complete.

## Private Node recovery

When the active Node.js is unsupported, the CLI can offer `Update NodeJS: Y/N [N]:` before loading OpenClaw. Enter **Y** to install a checksum-verified private runtime and retry the same command. Provisioning leaves system Node.js, shell settings, OpenClaw packages, and Gateway services unchanged; the retried command keeps its normal behavior. Enter **N**, press Enter, or cancel to receive manual upgrade instructions.

The installation offer requires both stdin and stderr to be interactive terminals. The CLI never prompts or installs a runtime in CI or with `--json`, `--yes`, or `--non-interactive`. Recovery supports x64/ARM64 macOS, Windows, and glibc Linux; Alpine/musl and other architectures require manual installation. Commands with an exact process identity requirement, including `hooks relay` and `webhooks gmail run`, keep their existing runtime requirement.

The CLI stores the private runtime under `~/.openclaw/tools/cli-node`, using `OPENCLAW_HOME` in place of the home directory when set. Later launches that need a supported runtime reuse a compatible runtime from that location, including non-interactive launches, without another installation prompt. A supported active Node.js takes precedence. The Node-only installer examples below populate this location explicitly; adjust their home paths if you use `OPENCLAW_HOME`. See [Node.js](/install/node) for manual installation guidance.

### Diagnostics on an unsupported Node

The launcher first reuses a compatible private runtime, including for diagnostics. Without one, diagnostics require Node 22 or newer with `node:sqlite` available. Older runtimes retain the interactive recovery offer or non-interactive refusal before any diagnostic code loads.

On a capable unsupported runtime, `openclaw --version`, `-V`, `--help`, `gateway status`, `doctor --lint`, `update status`, and `triage --json` or `triage --non-interactive` remain available. Plain `doctor` runs read-only lint checks on an unsupported Node. Repair flags, Gateway startup, and triage agent execution still require a supported runtime. `openclaw update` can report the exact Node installation instructions before admitting an update or writing its run ledger.

These commands print `Running on an unsupported Node (<version>); diagnostics may show truncated text`. Findings remain visible, including the CLI and recorded service Node versions and their repair instructions. `update status --json` includes `runtimeFindings` when present, and update-failure issue reports record the reporting process's Node version. A successful npm installation alone does not establish runtime compatibility: npm may skip the preinstall check.

Diagnostic readers preserve the live SQLite files. They may recover a disposable private copy so committed state remains readable after a crash; the runtime exemption does not permit writable live database access.

## Source build toolchain

For source installs, the installer selects pnpm after choosing the checkout ref.
It uses Corepack to create pnpm shims in an installer-owned temporary directory,
then runs them from the checkout so Corepack reads that target's package-manager
pin. The same directory leads `PATH` for nested install and build commands;
workspace and lockfile environment overrides are bound to the target checkout
for those children only. An older ambient `pnpm --version` is not a safe
selection probe: its version-switching path can modify the target lockfile.

If Corepack is missing or cannot provision the pinned version, the installers
use their selected npm executable to install that exact pnpm version into a
temporary prefix, retaining npm's version-specific lifecycle approval. They use
the executable from that prefix directly, including for nested commands. This
bootstrap neither activates global Corepack shims nor changes user pnpm config;
temporary shims and packages are cleaned up after the installer exits.

This does not install or replace the shell's global pnpm command. Before later
manual builds, follow [From source](/install#from-source) to select the
checkout-pinned toolchain rather than reusing an older ambient launcher.

## install.sh

<Tip>
Recommended for most interactive installs on macOS/Linux/WSL.
</Tip>

### Flow (install.sh)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect OS">
    Supports macOS and Linux (including WSL).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure a supported Node.js runtime">
    Checks the Node version and linked SQLite library, then installs Node if needed (Node 26 through Homebrew `node` on macOS; Node 24 LTS through NodeSource setup scripts on Linux apt/dnf/yum). On RPM-based Linux, a supported distro Node that links unsafe SQLite remains installed while OpenClaw receives a user-space Node runtime. On macOS, Homebrew is installed only when the installer needs it for Node or Git. Node 24.16+ and Node 26.1+ are supported; Node 22, 23, and 25 are unsupported.
    On Alpine/musl Linux, the installer uses apk packages instead of NodeSource and verifies the actual linked SQLite version. Current stable Alpine package streams can provide a new-enough Node with vulnerable system SQLite; when that happens, use an official `node:26-alpine` container or a glibc-based host instead.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure Git">
    Installs Git if missing using the detected package manager, including Homebrew on macOS and apk on Alpine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install OpenClaw">
    - `npm` method (default): global npm install
    - `git` method: clone/update repo, install deps with pnpm, build, then install wrapper at `~/.local/bin/openclaw`

  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-install tasks">
    - Resolves the just-installed `openclaw` binary for follow-up commands
    - npm-prefix and daemon-status probes use a default five-second timeout; completed probes return without waiting for that deadline.
    - For an unconfigured install, starts onboarding before doctor or gateway probes. With `--no-onboard` or no TTY, it prints the command to finish setup later.
    - For a configured install, refreshes and restarts a loaded gateway service best-effort and runs repair Doctor. Upgrade repair failures are fatal; plugin update failures remain warnings.
    - When `--verify` runs, it checks the installed version and checks gateway health only after configuration exists.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Source checkout detection

If run inside an OpenClaw checkout (`package.json` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml`), the script offers:

- use checkout (`git`), or
- use global install (`npm`)

If no TTY is available and no install method is set, it defaults to `npm` and warns.

The script exits with code `2` for invalid method selection or invalid `--install-method` values.

With `--install-method git`, `install.sh` and `install-cli.sh` accept a full
40-character commit SHA through `--version`. The installer uses the existing
object or fetches that exact commit from `origin`, checks it out detached, and
installs dependencies with a frozen lockfile. A branch with the same name cannot
replace the requested commit. `--no-git-update` skips branch rebasing; it does not
prevent fetching a missing requested commit. The install fails if the requested
object is unavailable or cannot resolve to a commit.

## install-cli.sh

<Info>
Designed for environments where you want everything under a local prefix
(default `~/.openclaw`) and no system Node dependency. Supports npm installs
by default, plus git-checkout installs under the same prefix flow.
</Info>

### Flow (install-cli.sh)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install local Node runtime">
    Downloads a pinned supported Node LTS tarball (the version is embedded in the script and updated independently, default `24.19.0`) to `<prefix>/tools/node-v<version>` and verifies SHA-256.
    Linux ARMv7 stops before installation because official Node 24+ ARMv7 binaries are unavailable. Use a 64-bit OS on compatible hardware or another supported host.
    On Alpine/musl Linux, where Node does not publish compatible tarballs for the pinned runtime, installs `nodejs` and `npm` with `apk`, then verifies both Node and the actual linked SQLite library. Current stable Alpine package streams may still link vulnerable SQLite even with a new-enough Node; use an official `node:26-alpine` container or a glibc-based host when the safety check rejects the package.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure Git">
    If Git is missing, attempts install via apt/dnf/yum/apk on Linux or Homebrew on macOS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install OpenClaw under prefix">
    - `npm` method (default): installs under the prefix with npm, then writes wrapper to `<prefix>/bin/openclaw`
    - `git` method: clones/updates a checkout (default `~/openclaw`) and still writes the wrapper to `<prefix>/bin/openclaw`

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the installed CLI">
    Runs `<prefix>/bin/openclaw --version` and stops with an error unless the
    installed wrapper exits successfully with a nonempty version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh loaded gateway service">
    If a gateway service is already loaded from that same prefix, the script runs
    `openclaw gateway install --force`, which activates the replacement service,
    and then probes gateway health best-effort.
  </Step>
</Steps>

With `--node-only`, `install-cli.sh` stops after provisioning Node into `<prefix>/tools/node-v<version>` and updating the `<prefix>/tools/node` alias. It skips Git, OpenClaw installation, onboarding, and Gateway service work. This mode refuses musl Linux before any system package-manager changes.

## install.ps1

### Flow (install.ps1)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure PowerShell + Windows environment">
    Requires PowerShell 5+.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure a supported Node.js runtime">
    If missing, attempts install via winget, then Chocolatey, then Scoop. If no package manager is available, the script downloads the official Node.js 26 Windows zip into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClaw\deps\portable-node` and adds it to the current process and user PATH. Node 24.16+ and Node 26.1+ are supported; Node 22, 23, and 25 are unsupported.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install OpenClaw">
    - `npm` method (default): global npm install using the selected `-Tag`, launched from a writable installer temp directory so shells opened in protected folders such as `C:\` still work
    - `git` method: clone/update repo, install/build with pnpm, and install wrapper at `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\openclaw.cmd`. If Git is missing, the script bootstraps user-local MinGit under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClaw\deps\portable-git` and adds it to the current process and user PATH.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-install tasks">
    - Adds needed bin directory to user PATH when possible
    - Refreshes a loaded gateway service best-effort (`openclaw gateway install --force`, then restart)
    - Runs `openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive` on upgrades and git installs; failure prevents an upgrade-success result

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle failures">
    `iwr ... | iex` and scriptblock installs report a terminating error without closing the current PowerShell session. Direct `powershell -File` / `pwsh -File` installs still exit non-zero for automation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

With `-NodeOnly`, `install.ps1` downloads the official Node archive, verifies its SHA-256 checksum and runtime compatibility, then installs Node with its matching npm/npx into `-NodePrefix`. The prefix must be an absolute private directory, not a filesystem root. This mode skips package managers, OpenClaw installation, onboarding, and Gateway service work, and leaves process, user, and machine PATH unchanged. `-NodePrefix` requires `-NodeOnly`; `-DryRun` previews the destination without installing.

<Note>
The complete native Windows launcher → PowerShell → downloaded Node handoff remains unproven on native Windows. PowerShell installer fixtures cover checksum failures and installation isolation, but do not establish that complete recovery flow.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is Git required?">
    Git is required for the `git` install method. For `npm` installs, Git is still checked/installed to avoid `spawn git ENOENT` failures when dependencies use git URLs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does npm hit EACCES on Linux?">
    Some Linux setups point npm's global prefix to root-owned paths. `install.sh` can switch the prefix to `~/.npm-global` and append PATH exports to shell rc files (when those files exist).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Windows: "npm error spawn git / ENOENT"'>
    Rerun the installer so it can bootstrap user-local MinGit, or install Git for Windows and reopen PowerShell.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Windows: "openclaw is not recognized"'>
    Run `npm config get prefix` and add that directory to your user PATH (no `\bin` suffix needed on Windows), then reopen PowerShell.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windows: how to get verbose installer output">
    `install.ps1` uses `CmdletBinding`, so it accepts PowerShell's common `-Verbose` parameter. The installer does not currently write a dedicated verbose stream. For script-level diagnostics, use PowerShell tracing:

    ```powershell
    Set-PSDebug -Trace 1
    & ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1))) -NoOnboard
    Set-PSDebug -Trace 0
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="openclaw not found after install">
    Usually a PATH issue. See [Node.js troubleshooting](/install/node#troubleshooting).

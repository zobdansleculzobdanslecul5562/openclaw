title: "Updating"

Keep OpenClaw up to date.

For Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes image replacements, see
[Upgrading container images](/install/docker#upgrading-container-images). The
gateway runs startup-safe upgrade work before readiness and exits if mounted
state needs manual repair.

Before a significant update, [create a verified backup](#before-updating-create-a-verified-backup).
Automatic config copies and migration recovery originals are not a full-state
backup.

## Recommended: `openclaw update`

Detects your install type (npm, pnpm, Bun, or git), checks the new version while
the old Gateway serves, then activates and verifies the update.

```bash
openclaw update
```

Managed-service inspection is best effort. If the service manager is unavailable,
including Linux hosts without systemd, the update continues and records a warning.
It leaves unverified service definitions unchanged and skips their automatic
restart. Restart the Gateway you launched manually after the update, or use its
actual supervisor. Doctor still checks for active state writers before migrations.

After package replacement, compatibility config reads from older updaters run
in a fresh process using the updated package and its dependencies. This also
applies to updates driven by 2026.9.4. If an optional read fails, the updater
prints `candidate-config-read-failed` and leaves the service definition unchanged.
Reads follow the restored package after a rollback. Inspect the reported problem
with the updated CLI after the update.

When a writable managed Gateway service points at another global installation,
the update keeps the active CLI's installation as its target and refreshes the
service through `gateway install --force` before verifying the restarted Gateway.
The old service command remains the recovery identity until that handoff succeeds.
Reconciliation failures are recorded as warnings with a manual repair command.
Deployment-owned definitions retain their existing installation owner.
Pending package-publication recovery in either the CLI or selected service
installation blocks writable preparation. Follow the package recovery command
reported by the update before retrying; Doctor does not clear those artifacts.

The installed 2026.9.4 updater can refuse with `managed-service-preflight` before
the target code runs. To reach a release containing this repair, use the
[manual package-manager procedure](/install/updating/update-methods#alternative-manual-npm-pnpm-or-bun)
with the same owning package manager, prefix, and state/configuration. Back up
first, stop the Gateway through its actual supervisor or foreground process owner,
replace the package, run Doctor, and restart through that same owner.
`--no-restart` cannot repair the old admission check.

Updaters without the admission fix first shipped in 2026.7.2-beta.5, including
2026.6.34–2026.6.35 and the 2026.7.33–2026.7.35 extended-stable line, refuse before staging with
`plugins.load.paths: plugin path not found` when a configured plugin path is missing.
Restore the custom plugin directory or remove its configured path, then update.
`openclaw doctor --fix` repairs recognized bundled-path aliases but preserves unrelated custom paths.

<Note>
On macOS, the 2026.9.4 Gateway's `update.run` action or `/update` can hand off
successfully, then fail at activation with `managed-service-preflight` and
"This command is running inside the gateway process tree." The installed
updater refuses its own managed helper before swapping packages, so a newer
candidate cannot repair that first update.

For this ancestry refusal, the owner should run `openclaw update` once from an
independent Terminal outside the Gateway process tree, using the same owning
account, installation, and state/configuration. After installing a release
containing the managed-helper authority fix, subsequent updates started through
`update.run` or `/update` use the corrected updater. The fix applies to updates
**from** the fixed version; it does not repair the 2026.9.4 macOS handoff in place.
</Note>

Registry updates inspect the exact candidate's Node requirement before staging.
An incompatible runtime produces `node-runtime-preflight`, with the target
version, required engine range, selected Node version, and an upgrade command.
npm directory permission failures produce `global-install-permission-denied`,
naming the directory, its owner when available, and the next action. Dry-run JSON
includes these outcomes in `failures`; the update report and Doctor's update
history retain recorded failures. The serving Gateway stays in place during
these preflight checks.

These checks run in the **installed updater**. Older updaters cannot gain new
preflight behavior from the candidate they have not installed yet. If upgrading
from an older release, check [Node requirements](/install/node) and the npm
prefix's permissions first; see [update troubleshooting](/install/update-troubleshooting#node-and-global-install-permissions).

<Note>
On FreeBSD, OpenClaw 2026.9.4 can stop before staging an update with
`managed handoff process start identity is unavailable`. Changing the target or
adding `--no-restart` cannot repair the installed updater.

For a pkg or Ports installation, update through pkg or Ports; do not overwrite
its files with npm. For an npm-owned installation, use the
[manual package-manager procedure](/install/updating/update-methods#alternative-manual-npm-pnpm-or-bun)
from a separate shell, with the same owning npm, installation prefix, and
Gateway state/configuration. Select a published version whose release notes
include the FreeBSD fixes; changes on `main` are not a published release.

Stop and start the Gateway through its actual supervisor or foreground process
owner around the manual replacement. This recovery does not add CLI-managed
FreeBSD rc.d service updates.
</Note>

An already-installed registry package version or Git target SHA still runs plugin maintenance, repairs eligible old OpenClaw release pins, and restarts a running managed Gateway when plugins change or its service points at another installation, unless `--no-restart` is set. Unchanged runs finish as `skipped` / `already-current`.

Plugin maintenance does not fail an otherwise successful core update. If a plugin
cannot be updated, OpenClaw continues with the remaining plugins, keeps the previous
installation where possible, and prints a short next action. A running updated
Gateway can also report a plugin that did not load without turning the core update
into a failure. Individual plugin outcomes remain available in `--json` output.
Failures to install core, repair required configuration or state, or start the
updated Gateway remain update failures.
Local copies selected through `plugins.load.paths` are operator-managed. Updates
and `openclaw update repair` retain the selected copy and any npm install it
shadows, and record a `plugin-operator-managed` warning in the outcome and update
history. Verify that copy against the updated OpenClaw version, or remove its
path from `plugins.load.paths` to use the managed installation again. This does
not grant the local copy trusted plugin privileges.
An explicit package artifact (for example, a tarball path or URL) is validated
and installed even when its version matches; matching versions do not prove
that two artifacts contain the same code.
An explicit `--channel` choice still becomes the saved update channel.
For versions that support checks before installation, health checks, config and plugin planning, and a
test Gateway boot on copied state finish before the service stops. The stopped interval
contains the swap, required migrations, plugin downloads and convergence, and
service start. Plugin work uses the installed target without requiring a serving
Gateway. A changed plugin snapshot runs fresh Doctor migrations before restart;
unchanged plugins do not run another full Doctor pass. The final report records
downtime through convergence and final verification, plus verification
results. See
[Validation and activation](/cli/update#validation-and-activation) for the checks.

The canary uses a temporary loopback Gateway port and suppresses background
listeners, including the MCP Apps sandbox, browser control, and channel services.
This lets validation run while the serving Gateway keeps its configured ports.
It preserves non-secret Gateway auth settings such as `gateway.auth.rateLimit`
for policy checks, while using a temporary token and disabling Tailscale identity
authentication.
The activated Gateway retains your normal listener settings.
The canary verifies the copied plugin payloads without downloading replacements.
It warns when plugin refresh is deferred; live update finalization owns that
refresh, so a slow registry cannot consume the canary's startup budget.
This candidate-side behavior also applies when the installed updater is 2026.9.3.
That older updater still caps the entire validation sequence at five minutes;
its `--timeout` option cannot increase this cap.

Package updates also check npm availability for enabled configured plugins before
stopping the serving Gateway or replacing the installed core. Registry targets
are checked early; explicit package artifacts are checked using the privately
staged package version before private validation, live-state preparation, or activation.
The check uses the same plugin version rules as post-update synchronization,
including release-cohort tracking, beta selection, and extended-stable targets.
A missing plugin version or registry error produces a warning naming the
affected plugin; the core update can continue. Registry-target `--dry-run`
includes those warnings. For explicit artifacts, `--dry-run` does not stage the
package and reports that plugin availability checking remains pending.
Extended-stable does not accept `--tag`. Bundled and path-installed plugins do not
require registry requests.

This metadata check does not reserve downloads. Plugin-only download, install,
or load failures remain actionable warnings after an otherwise successful core
update. The updater preserves recorded choices and retains the previous plugin
payload where possible. Follow the reported `openclaw plugins update <id>` command for a
failed install or update, or `openclaw doctor --fix` for a load problem. Invalid
configuration or state, ownership errors, and failed core startup or readiness
checks still prevent completion.

Switch channels or target a specific version:

```bash
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel extended-stable
openclaw update --channel dev
openclaw update --dry-run   # preview without applying
```

`openclaw update` has no `--verbose` flag (the installer does). For diagnostics use
`--dry-run` to preview planned actions, `--json` for structured results, or
`openclaw update status --json` to inspect channel and availability state.

`--channel beta` selects the newest version by semantic version order from the
beta and latest npm dist-tags. Use `--tag beta` for a one-off package update pinned to the raw npm
beta dist-tag instead.

A saved `update.channel` remains the channel for future updates, automatic
checks, and update status. For example, a one-off beta package on a saved stable
channel keeps checking stable afterward. Use `--channel beta` to subscribe to
beta updates. Plugins still follow the installed core version where required
for compatibility.

`--channel extended-stable` is package-only, and installation remains
foreground-only. OpenClaw reads the public npm `extended-stable` selector,
verifies the selected exact package, and installs that exact version. Missing
or inconsistent registry data fails closed; it never falls back to `latest`.
If the selected version is older than the installed version, the normal
downgrade confirmation still applies. The CLI persists the channel after a
successful core update; a direct
`npm install -g openclaw@extended-stable --allow-scripts=openclaw` does not
update `update.channel`, but a final extended-stable package version still
checks only the verified `extended-stable` selector for update availability.
That direct command is for npm 12 or npm 11.16+. On npm 11.15 and earlier,
omit `--allow-scripts=openclaw`.
After the core swap, eligible official npm and trusted official ClawHub plugins with bare/default or
`latest` intent converge to that exact core version. Eligible older OpenClaw release
pins resume that default update policy. Explicit non-`latest` tags, independently
versioned pins, third-party plugins, custom ClawHub registries, and other sources retain
their existing behavior.
Version-bound runtime plugins converge to the base release cohort when the
core is a correction release (for example, `YYYY.M.P-2` uses plugin
`YYYY.M.P`).
Catalog installs created by current OpenClaw versions retain that default
intent. Verified OpenClaw-owned packages recorded at an exact OpenClaw release
no newer than core resume their catalog's default selector after a successful
update. This includes old automatic and manual pins. Their recorded registry
and plugin settings are preserved, and subsequent updates continue following
the selected channel. A version explicitly supplied to a plugin update command
still applies to that operation.

`--channel dev` gives a persistent moving GitHub `main` checkout for npm-owned
package installs and existing Git checkouts. Package
installs reject the `--tag main` shorthand because the workspace checkout is
not a self-contained package artifact. Use `openclaw update --channel dev` to
switch to the supported checkout and build flow. Other explicit package specs
keep their package-manager behavior.

On source installs, Doctor and plugin updates keep plugins built with the host.
A registry plugin with the same version string can target a different SDK, so
it does not replace the source build without matching SDK build evidence.
Existing registry generations remain on disk; convergence reports the bundled
selection and skips their refresh. `OPENCLAW_DEV_SOURCE_ROOT` is not required.

Managed npm plugins on the beta channel use the same newest-of-beta/latest
selection, including official plugins such as `@openclaw/codex`. An older beta
tag cannot hold a plugin behind the current stable release. Startup repair
leaves already-current packages in place so a no-op refresh does not require
another restart.

See [Release channels](/install/development-channels) for channel semantics.

### Updating from 2026.9.2 across a schema bump

Updates driven by OpenClaw 2026.9.2 can cross a shared-state schema bump normally.
The target applies the migration content while retaining the old published
schema version, so the old updater can finish its ledger writes and final
report. Doctor explains that schema content is applied and version publication
is deferred. The new Gateway runs on the migrated content during this interval.

Publication waits until every affected update run has been terminal for at least
five minutes. A running row that has not changed for more than 30 minutes counts
as abandoned for publication purposes only; this does not terminalize an
identityless update-history row. The Gateway watcher publishes after the deadline;
a later database open can also publish it. See the precise timing and residual
old-CLI limitation in [Database schemas](/reference/database-schemas#schema-bumps-and-older-updaters).

When agent databases also need migration, the candidate first rehearses Doctor
on private copies while the published updater can still roll back its package.
After package commit, the fresh post-core process acquires current executor
authority and delegates Doctor. Doctor verifies a retained recovery archive
covering each agent database before migrating live state. The updater then
restarts the Gateway.

Missing state metadata or unverified backup coverage can still produce
`update-schema-bump-unfenced` with database versions and recovery instructions.
Before package commit, let the failed update finish restoring the previous
package. OpenClaw 2026.9.2 leaves the Gateway service stopped after failed
post-install verification. After package commit, the old package backup is gone:
finish `openclaw doctor --fix` with the installed compatible build, then run
`openclaw gateway start`. Package rollback cannot undo migrated state.

If the compatible package still needs installation, run
the manual update from a shell outside the Gateway, replacing `<target>` with
the exact target version from the refusal:

```bash
openclaw gateway stop
npm install -g openclaw@<target> --allow-scripts=openclaw
openclaw doctor --fix
openclaw gateway start
```

Run each command only after the previous one succeeds. On npm 11.15 and earlier,
omit `--allow-scripts=openclaw`. For a pnpm-owned install, replace the install
command with `pnpm add -g --allow-build=openclaw openclaw@<target>`; for Bun, use
`bun add -g --trust openclaw@<target>`.

Same-schema updates, earlier ledger-less updaters such as 2026.9.1, and fenced
transactional updaters from 2026.9.3 onward keep their existing behavior. The
fallback does not undo an earlier migration; if the database is already newer
than the restored package, install a compatible target and finish Doctor before
starting the Gateway.

For a Git checkout updated by 2026.9.2, a Doctor refusal before state writes
prints source recovery commands when the checkout's reflog identifies the
previous commit unambiguously. Wait for the updater to exit, then follow the
printed checkout, `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, and service-start guidance from
an independent shell. If the previous commit cannot be verified, Doctor points
you to the reflog instead. A refusal after state repairs keeps the migration
owner's instructions: restoring source alone does not restore state.
These diagnostics also enter the warning log, subject to normal logging settings
and rotation. After resolving the refusal cause, retry the update. Once the
upgrade succeeds, subsequent updates check the new version before activation.

### From chat

Ask the agent to update OpenClaw, or send `/update` from Discord or another
connected chat. Natural-language requests use the existing `gateway` tool's
`update.run` action. The minimal, coding, and messaging profiles expose that update
action without granting configuration reads or other Gateway controls. Explicit tool
restrictions still apply.

Operator-created scheduled automations can also call `gateway` → `update.run`
without a chat owner identity. The Gateway uses the active scheduled run's
authority; a notification destination does not become its requester. Jobs created
by external chat users and webhook turns do not gain this authority. External
chat update requests still require `commands.ownerAllowFrom`; the refusal tells
the operator which sender to add.

`/update` is the model-independent fallback: it works without a functioning model
or access to the `gateway` tool. The tool, slash command, and Control UI all use
the same Gateway update handler and current authorization checks.

The new version is checked while the old Gateway serves. An already-current
update restarts a running Gateway when plugins change or its service points at a
different installation. Update runs can send these notices in that chat as the
Gateway observes the recorded milestones:

1. An acknowledgement when the update is accepted.
2. `⏳ Restarting the gateway now (v<from> → v<to>)…` when activation is recorded before the Gateway stops.
3. `🔁 Back on v<to>, verifying…` when the new Gateway starts verification.
4. The final report, including successful updates.

External update and restart notices go only to destinations listed in
`commands.ownerAllowFrom`. Selecting a non-owner chat in the Control UI does not
authorize notices to that contact. If no owner destination resolves, OpenClaw
logs the skipped notice and keeps the update outcome in the run record and
Control UI; it does not redirect the notice to another chat or wake the rejected
session with diagnostics.

Update lifecycle notices also honor the destination account's `actions.sendMessage`
policy. An explicit account setting overrides the channel default; when neither
sets the flag, notices are allowed. Disabled sends are recorded as skipped notices
without preventing the update or its Control UI report.

Managed systemd or launchd updates can stop the Gateway before an intermediate
notice is delivered. The complete four-message sequence is not guaranteed for
those installations; the durable run report remains available after reconnect.

Runs with an internal origin session, including Control UI and webchat, receive
these notices directly in that session's transcript. Passing only `sessionKey`
is enough; the caller does not need to supply `deliveryContext`.
Before stopping the managed service, the updater waits for the serving Gateway
to finish its restart notice attempt. That wait is capped at 10 seconds so a
stalled notice cannot block activation.

The report includes the outcome, recorded phase durations, failed steps,
verification facts, and the next action when needed. A run sends each notice
at most once; an update that stops before restart sends only the notices for
phases it reached. If the update cannot start, the bot records and explains why
and provides the manual command when available.
The agent relays the returned recovery instructions to the operator. Manual
update commands run in a terminal outside the Gateway service; the agent must
not execute them in the shell of the Gateway hosting its session. A missing
owner permission requires owner setup, and an externally supervised installation
uses its deployment owner's update workflow.

Chat, CLI, Control UI, and automatic updates share a durable run ID. Use
`openclaw update status` to read the active or latest report, including after a
restart; `--json` exposes the `activeRun` and `lastRun` records. See
[Run history and reports](/cli/update#run-history-and-reports) for Gateway history
queries.

The sender must be in [`commands.ownerAllowFrom`](/tools/slash-commands#configuration).
Being allowed to chat does not grant owner permissions. If your account is not
an owner, the reply explains how the Gateway operator can connect it. Channel
setup and [pairing](/channels/pairing) distinguish owner access from chat access;
existing allowed users are not automatically promoted.
External-chat updates through `/update` or the tool require `commands.restart`
(enabled by default), including managed installations. The slash command also
follows command-access restrictions; tool calls follow tool policy. Chat updates use the hosting installation's
configured update channel and install method.
Agents must never run `npm install -g openclaw` or stop the Gateway service
from a chat shell; use `/update` or the update action so restart and notification
stay coordinated.

## Inspect FreeBSD service discovery

The standalone `scripts/freebsd-service-inspect.mjs` diagnostic reports which
`openclaw` rc.d definitions the native configuration selects. It requires a
root-owned Node installation, script, and shared discovery helper. It does not
require the OpenClaw Ports service package.

From an existing root shell, install the script from a trusted OpenClaw package:

```sh
install -d -o root -g wheel -m 0755 /usr/local/libexec/lib
install -o root -g wheel -m 0644 /path/to/openclaw/scripts/freebsd-service-inspect.mjs /usr/local/libexec/openclaw-service-inspect.mjs
install -o root -g wheel -m 0644 /path/to/openclaw/scripts/lib/freebsd-service-discovery.mjs /usr/local/libexec/lib/freebsd-service-discovery.mjs
(cd / && /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/ PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin LC_ALL=C /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/libexec/openclaw-service-inspect.mjs)
```

Use your root-owned Node path if it differs. Clear the environment before Node
starts, as shown, to exclude Node preload options. The command accepts no arguments.
It reads native administrator shell configuration as root and requests no
service lifecycle operation. Administrator configuration is trusted shell code,
not a sandboxed data format.

The result includes the exact clean environment and working directory used for
discovery. It corresponds to `service` invoked with that same context. Configuration
that depends on another environment or directory can select different services.

The single JSON result reports `absent`, `present`, or `unknown`. Present results
include executable and non-executable definitions, their native search order,
and the first executable definition. Symlinks, unsafe ownership, incomplete
inspection, or unexpected configuration output produce `unknown` and exit 1.
Configuration contents and subprocess errors are not included in the result.

This is a diagnostic observation. It does not establish process or package
ownership, authorize an update, or enable CLI-managed rc.d service updates.
Continue to use the installation owner's update procedure above.

## Stale update history

Untouched, identityless legacy admissions older than 24 hours can
[expire automatically](/cli/update/status-and-history#run-history-and-reports)
during Gateway startup or a status check. The row is retained as `failed` with
reason `legacy-driver-expired` and retry advice; no explicit repair is needed
for that shape.

If update status stays in progress while the Gateway is healthy, check that no
update is still running. On the updated installation, run:

```bash
openclaw update repair
openclaw update status
```

For an inactive legacy row older than 30 minutes, repair verifies that the
running Gateway matches the installed version and build, then clears the stale
run without maintenance or a service restart. A new explicit `openclaw update`
can also supersede a single stale identityless row. Recent rows and recorded
live drivers are protected. Identityless rows outside the legacy-expiry shape
require explicit recovery; the Control UI's configuration-write suspension clears
after reconciliation.

Repair started within the owning update can continue with a matching inherited
run ID and live process identity; the run records that continuation. Repair
still refuses an unrelated live or stalled updater. The error identifies its
run, phase, driver PID, host, start and last-activity ages, and observed liveness.
Wait for that update to finish, or stop the named driver on its host and rerun
repair after it exits. See [Update repair](/cli/update/repair-and-recovery#update-repair)
for maintenance and recovery behavior.

OpenClaw 2026.9.2 does not reject a new CLI update because an older running row
exists: its [admission path](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/v2026.9.2/src/cli/update-cli/update-command-run.ts#L77)
creates a new run, and its [ledger](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/v2026.9.2/src/infra/update-run-ledger.ts#L250)
checks only for a duplicate run ID. Upgrade normally, then use the updated
`openclaw update repair` if the old history remains. A package-manager escape
is not required for this ledger defect. See [Update run history](/cli/update#run-history-and-reports).

## Retire update recovery data

Once you have verified the update and your conversations, preview retained
migration originals:

```bash
openclaw update cleanup --dry-run
```

Use the same profile and state/config overrides as the update, and check the
state directory printed in the report. The metadata-only preview can run while
the Gateway is active. To apply, stop that Gateway yourself, wait for other
SQLite maintenance to finish, and stop database readers such as session-listing
watchers. Keep them stopped until `openclaw update cleanup` exits; read-only
connections can change WAL/SHM sidecars and invalidate verification. Cleanup never
stops or restarts the Gateway. Confirmation defaults to **No**; automation must
explicitly pass `--yes`, including when using `--json`.

Cleanup permanently gives up rollback to eligible originals, including repaired
branches and old provider metadata. Current SQLite history, operator backups,
and protected or unknown artifacts remain. It is not a substitute for a
[pre-update backup](#before-updating-create-a-verified-backup). See
[Update cleanup](/cli/update#update-cleanup) for eligibility, JSON output, and
resuming interrupted deletion.
Private package, command-shim, and Git runtime backups remain owned by the update
transaction and are outside this migration cleanup. An interrupted entry in update
history does not block cleanup of otherwise eligible migration archives.

## After updating

Successful managed `openclaw update` runs already restart and verify the Gateway.
Use these steps after a manual installation or when checking a reported problem.

<Steps>

### Run doctor

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

Migrates config, audits DM policies, and checks gateway health. Doctor also compares active official plugins with the OpenClaw package the managed service will load after restart. Resolve any plugin restart-readiness warning before continuing. Details: [Doctor](/gateway/doctor)

If you use the unpacked Chrome extension, also run `openclaw browser doctor --browser-profile chrome`.
For a version-mismatch warning, reload the extension from `chrome://extensions`;
fully restart Chrome if the warning remains.

### Restart the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Verify

```bash
openclaw health
```

</Steps>

### Background exec notifications after an update

`[OpenClaw exec completion]` identifies an automatic follow-up for a background
command, rather than a recurring heartbeat poll. These follow-ups can run with
`agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: "0m"`. To keep background exec without these
extra model calls, set `tools.exec.notifyOnExit: false` and check per-agent
overrides at `agents.entries.<id>.tools.exec.notifyOnExit`. Use `process poll` to
collect results. See [Background exec notifications](/gateway/background-process#disable-automatic-completion-turns)
for when the setting takes effect.

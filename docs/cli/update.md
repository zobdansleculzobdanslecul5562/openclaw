# `openclaw update`

Update OpenClaw and switch between stable/extended-stable/beta/dev channels.

If you installed via **npm/pnpm/bun** (global install, no git metadata),
updates go through the package-manager flow described in
[Updating](/install/updating).

On Windows, update checks the Gateway Scheduled Task's principal and run level
before staging or changing state. A per-user `LeastPrivilege` task for the current
account can be updated from a non-elevated terminal, including a UAC-filtered
administrator's terminal. A task for another account (including SYSTEM), a task
that requires highest privileges, or a genuine Task Scheduler query denial needs
an **elevated terminal** (Run as administrator), even if the Gateway is stopped.
Unresolved or group principals defer to native permission checks. Task lookup has its
own 60-second cold-start limit, and each `schtasks` command has a 15-second limit;
a stalled operation names the check or command instead of using the update's full
timeout.

For a global npm installation, the manual recovery path is
`npm i -g openclaw@<target> --allow-scripts=openclaw`, then
`openclaw doctor --fix`, then `openclaw gateway restart`. Replace `<target>` with
the intended release and run service repair/restart from an elevated terminal
if Task Scheduler denies access. OpenClaw prints this alternative; it does not
run it automatically. Per-user Startup-folder installations do not require
elevation for this check. An older installed updater keeps its previous behavior
until replaced; use the elevated or manual path for that first upgrade.

Custom npm prefixes such as `~/.npm-global` are recognized from npm's configured
prefix and the installed OpenClaw launcher. A prefix configured in `~/.npmrc`
does not need a matching `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` environment variable. If no owner
can be identified, the CLI includes the inspected package, prefix, and launcher
paths and the package-manager check results in its guidance.
Installation inspection also reports the root, Git metadata, `node_modules`
layout, and service unit target (or why it was not inspected). An unrecognized
root skips target preflight and gives commands to locate the owning installation.

An older updater that stops before staging cannot use this repair. For a known
npm installation, supply its configured prefix explicitly for that update:
`NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX="$(npm prefix -g)" openclaw update`.

An installation without a detected package-manager owner records a **skipped**
update, exits successfully, and leaves the Gateway running. For Docker/container
images, pull or build the new image and recreate the container with the same
state/config mounts. For a standalone or extracted tarball installation, reinstall
using the original method; Yarn global installations must be updated with Yarn.
The CLI displays this next action. Existing profiles also record it in update
history and include it in JSON as `run.origin.nextAction`. With `--json`, a fresh
profile emits the guidance to stderr and does not create a state database for a
skipped update. These non-outcomes do not run rollback verification or offer an
update failure report.

## Usage

```bash
openclaw update
openclaw update status
openclaw update repair
openclaw update cleanup --dry-run
openclaw update wizard
openclaw update --channel extended-stable
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel dev
openclaw update --tag beta
openclaw update --dry-run
openclaw update --no-restart
openclaw update --yes
openclaw update --accept-capabilities
openclaw update --json
openclaw --update
```

`openclaw --update` rewrites to `openclaw update` (useful for shells and
launcher scripts).

Invalid configuration reports `invalid-config` before database schema inspection.
An unreadable configuration file or failed configuration loading step instead
reports `config-read-failed`, with a recognized filesystem error code when available.
For supported package targets, the candidate makes that
decision after private staging; see [Candidate-owned admission](#candidate-owned-admission).
The local diagnostic identifies invalid fields and recommends
`openclaw doctor --fix`, followed by correcting any remaining errors. A dry run
keeps this guidance in its JSON `notes` without changing the configuration.
Public failure reports retain the rejected schema area, such as `gateway.*`,
while hiding operator-defined keys and rejected values. Admission still runs
when the selected package version matches the installed version; the no-op
decision follows validation of the selected artifact and live installation.
When switching channels, Doctor can prepare a read-only projection of supported
legacy fields for database checks. Each projection stays bound to its original
config bytes and include files. If the managed service uses another profile,
caller and service projections remain separate; inspecting the caller does not
rewrite its configuration.
Guided recovery recognizes the saved config failure after a later successful
update and still verifies the installed runtime and Gateway readiness.

The 2026.9.4 updater reports this condition as `database-schema-preflight` and
can show `mode: unknown` even after resolving an npm target. Before another
update or dry run replaces the latest history, run `openclaw update status --json`
and inspect `lastRun.origin.nextAction` and `lastRun.target` for the recorded
reason and target. A candidate release cannot repair an installed updater that
refuses before staging it; correct the configuration before retrying.

Updaters without the admission fix first shipped in 2026.7.2-beta.5 (including 2026.6.34–2026.6.35 and the 2026.7.33–2026.7.35 extended-stable line) also refuse before staging with `plugins.load.paths: plugin path not found`; restore a missing custom plugin directory or remove its configured path before retrying. `openclaw doctor --fix` can repair recognized bundled-path aliases and preserves unrelated custom paths.

Update admission recognizes orphan `task_delivery_state` rows whose parent tasks
are missing as repairable. When it can acquire Doctor's ownership fences, it runs
the same [preservation-first recovery](/reference/database-schemas/integrity-and-recovery#doctor-reports-orphan-task-delivery-rows)
before creating update history. Recovery and its ledger entry commit together;
the entry records the row count and recovery directory. A live Gateway owner,
read-only store, or failed preservation prevents repair and reports
`openclaw doctor --fix` as the next action. Other foreign-key violations and
structural damage still refuse admission.
`--dry-run` reports the repairable condition without recovering rows or creating
an update ledger entry for that refused preview.

The installed 2026.9.4 updater cannot use this recovery before updating itself.
If it refuses with a database integrity error, install the corrective release
manually and run `openclaw doctor --fix`.

Failed update and repair attempts enter [recovery triage](/cli/update#recover-a-failed-update)
after service recovery and cleanup finish. Preflight and finalization join admitted
command cleanup before handing off ownership or reporting completion. If cleanup
cannot confirm that work stopped, the updater retains any acquired ownership and
recovery artifacts and skips automatic service compensation and repair. Inspect
`openclaw update status` and resolve the pending execution before retrying.
Repair settles only native commands belonging to its Doctor. Another Doctor's
retained command is recorded as foreign custody with its Doctor PID, without
making the completed Doctor unsettled. Installation replacement remains blocked
while any live command claim exists.
A verified rollback does not automatically start triage: the previous generation
is running again, and the report keeps the failing check as the reason.
An interactive update offers the diagnose/report menu with **Exit** selected by
default. Declining or cancelling preserves the failed update's nonzero exit
status. JSON, non-interactive, `--yes`, and managed-service handoff invocations do
not prompt after rollback.

Update completion prints the terminal outcome and a local Markdown report path before exiting, including unexpected failures. Failed runs keep rollback-facing diagnostic JSON within the released 8 KiB limit. That file links a separate artifact containing every individually bounded Doctor finding; the Markdown report also retains the complete inventory. JSON output includes `reportPath`; a report-write failure prints a warning and preserves the update outcome.

Exit always waits for accepted state operations, pending database opens, and live
worker references to settle. After settlement, retained-worker native close and
thread termination have a ten-second grace period. Expiry records a warning,
keeps the retained runtime for later cleanup, and preserves the command's exit
status. This protection belongs to the installed updater: installing a release
with the fix enables it for the next update that release performs.

The executable CLI retains its shared-state and worker cleanup code before an
update can replace those files. Older installed development builds can finish an
update successfully and then exit with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` during CLI cleanup.
Check `openclaw update status` with the newly installed CLI to distinguish that
exit failure from the recorded update outcome; the installed driver needs the fix
before it performs its next update.

Updating from inside the installation keeps captured paths anchored to the
invoking directory while the package is replaced. The updater keeps a valid
working directory for background workers and restores the original directory
when it still exists. This protection also belongs to the installed updater;
a new candidate cannot change the working directory of an older driver.

When a Dashboard update fails while the Gateway handles the request, the Gateway
logs a warning with the public reason and a safe error summary. Successful and
intentional no-op update logs are unchanged. This only affects Gateway logging,
not the installed updater, rollback, or the Dashboard RPC response.

After a final interactive update failure, **Diagnose update failure** and
**Report update failure** are separate choices. Reporting first shows the exact
sanitized issue body and defaults confirmation to **No**. After confirmation,
OpenClaw checks the GitHub CLI's active `github.com` account with a silent,
read-only request before issue creation. Fallback and pending outcomes retain the
sanitized report locally; a confirmed issue keeps only its durable issue URL.
If the CLI is missing, authentication is unavailable, or GitHub rejects the
upload, OpenClaw keeps the sanitized report locally and returns to the previous
action menu. Fix the problem, then choose **Report update failure** and confirm
again to retry the same report, or choose **Report in browser** to review and
submit it with your browser's GitHub account. The browser choice is available
when the prepared report fits a prefilled link and no uncertain upload is pending;
it does not require the GitHub CLI. Completed update and Doctor checks are not
rerun. Preparation or submission errors also return to the menu. An uncertain
upload stays pending: **Check report status** looks for the existing issue without
creating another one, and no browser handoff is offered.
Successful submission, explicit exit, and cancellation retain their normal
behavior; Diagnose runs only when selected explicitly.
In the Control UI, an interrupted
pre-create preparation becomes retryable after its local reservation expires.
After an uncertain creation result, OpenClaw checks for an issue matching the
exact report. If neither a verified issue URL nor a definitive rejection is
available, the report stays pending with no replay link because an issue may
already exist.
`--yes`, `--json`, non-interactive runs, and managed-service handoffs never
submit a report.

For admitted updates, unexpected exceptions retain a bounded, redacted error identity and source location
in update history, along with the operation reached and the installation and target
facts resolved so far. Failure reports include the initiating action and the owner's
recorded rollback outcome. Failed steps use stable identifiers such as
`candidate-state-snapshot`, `candidate-doctor-lint`, and `post-install-verify` in
the report body and issue title; command arguments and private paths remain redacted.
Snapshot errors identify the active database, execution approvals, or plugin phase.
Schema inspection failures put recognized worker error codes and causes before private
source context, including causes after warning lines, so they survive redaction. Saved
diagnostic lines omit a path and its trailing text, including quoted paths whose filenames
may themselves contain spaces or quotes.
A completed database snapshot does not establish that later plugin paths are readable;
inspect the source path and filesystem error named by the failing phase.
A failure during installation or target resolution keeps
that resolution step visible. Older updater processes cannot recover details they
already discarded; a report generated by newer code only includes facts that were
recorded by the updater that handled the failure.

Managed updates preserve a completed child's refusal reason and failure details
in update history, even when its notification has already been consumed. Settings
→ Updates reads those same recorded facts. For `update-recovery-pending`, inspect
the retained activation's diagnostic and follow its exact recovery command; the
original recovery owner still decides whether repair or retirement is safe.
A child that produces no usable result is reported as
`managed-service-handoff-failed`. A refusal before service parking leaves the
serving Gateway untouched.

Npm install failures record a recognized error code (or `unknown`) and a sanitized
excerpt of `npm ERR!` / `npm error` lines in update history and the reviewed report.
The existing history format retains at most five lines of 200 UTF-8 bytes each;
permission guidance reserves one of those entries. Home paths, credentials, and
authenticated registry URLs are redacted before the excerpt is recorded.
For `EACCES` or `EPERM`, check `npm prefix -g` and run the update as the installing
account with write access to that prefix. For `ENOSPC`, free space on the prefix
and npm cache volumes. For `E404` or `ETARGET`, check the configured registry and
the requested version or tag. The generated report includes the applicable next
step. An already-running older updater cannot gain this diagnostic capture from
its candidate package.

On Windows, a temporarily locked live package can prevent the updater from renaming
it into its backup location. The updater retries `EPERM`, `EBUSY`, and `EACCES`
with bounded backoff (16 attempts and up to 57.75 seconds of waiting), recording
each retry as a warning. If the rename still fails, the failure names both paths
and leaves the installed package in place. Close processes holding that installation
and check its permissions before retrying. This protection belongs to the installed
updater; a newer candidate cannot add it to an older updater already running.

## Immutable release installations

An explicitly adopted Linux installation can prepare and activate sealed releases with
`openclaw update`. Its root contains `releases/<full-commit-sha>` and a `current`
symlink selecting the running generation. A matching directory layout alone does
not grant update ownership.

Preparation resolves official `main` once, or accepts an exact
`--sha <40-hex-commit>`, builds off-path, verifies and seals the candidate, and
records its preparation. Preparation failure leaves the serving generation in
place; an already-current target skips the build. Existing adoption records
remain preparation-only. Native activation requires explicit
`adopt-immutable --enable-activation` consent recorded in the installation's
control database. No `openclaw.json` option enables it. `--no-restart` keeps an
enabled installation preparation-only for that invocation.

Immutable preparation requires a separately adopted build account and toolchain.
The build account must differ from the runtime account, have no supplementary
groups, and match the recorded numeric identity. The updater runs dependency
installation and builds in a restricted systemd service with a private home,
temporary directory, memory limit, and task limit. Its environment excludes the
runtime account's credentials and its filesystem view protects runtime state,
service definitions, and existing releases. The updater waits for the entire
build cgroup to stop before copying and sealing the new generation as root.

Build storage admission and the runtime account's write/quota probe run
separately. A failed admission, installation, build, or process-settlement check
leaves the existing service and `current` pointer unchanged. Uncertain process
settlement retains the build scratch for inspection. Installations without an
adopted build identity can still inspect status, reuse an already prepared
generation, and detect an already-current target; preparing a new target reports
the missing adoption. Build-identity adoption is staged for the native immutable
update rollout and is not exposed as an `openclaw.json` setting or CLI flag yet.

`--drain-timeout <seconds>` sets the immutable drain budget independently of
`--timeout`, which retains the canary/readiness phase budget. The default drain
budget comes from the existing restart deferral policy (300 seconds). Drain
completes immediately when ready; after its budget,
the native suspension owner can interrupt ordinary work while preserving
unresolved write custody. For a 30-second drain, use `--drain-timeout 30`.
The flag is rejected on mutable installations.
After native service inspection, the updater asks the Gateway to commit shutdown
under the original suspension. An expired or resumed suspension refuses that
handoff. Once committed, the host owns one-way shutdown; resume and lease expiry
cannot reopen admission while native stop waits for dispatch.
The stable launcher reads the same activation record before starting a Gateway.
Stop and pointer-publication phases block supervisor replacements from admitting
work; the native owner explicitly authorizes startup after publication.

When enabled, the native updater drains through the Gateway suspension owner,
stops the old service, publishes `current` under a fenced activation record,
starts the selected generation, and verifies its process, build, authenticated
health, HTTP readiness, plugins, and channels. Build and install work stay outside
cutover. Startup responses with `status: "starting"`, including agent database
inspection, keep the readiness wait open within its bounded budget. An
inconclusive check retains the recovery record; it does not establish failure.
Candidate-authored additive startup config migrations require matching config
audit evidence and preserved policy. Other config or state identity changes
refuse completion.

Verified activation retires the operation record. A real activation failure may
restore the sealed predecessor when the protected state remains compatible;
rollback retains a resumable record. This slice does not rewind migrated
databases or collect release directories. It supports matching database schema
contracts only; incompatible migration requirements refuse activation before
drain. Canary rehearsal boots the candidate against isolated copies before
cutover, preserving input that the candidate itself must migrate at startup.
It does not pre-repair that input with Doctor. No live Doctor or optional NOCOW
rewrite runs inside this activation.
After live readiness, the updater repeats that startup-only canary against a
fresh private copy while the selected Gateway serves, then verifies the same
live PID and boot once more before completing activation. This is canary proof;
it does not dispatch a model marker turn.
JSON distinguishes preparation
(`prepared`) from activation (`succeeded`, `rolled-back`, `pending`, or `error`).
`pending`, `rolled-back`, and `error` return a nonzero exit status.

`openclaw update --dry-run` reports the immutable target without adoption,
preparation, or publication. `openclaw update status` includes the current and
prepared generation identities and activation enablement. Its immutable receipt
fields are also available under `update.immutable` in `--json`:

- `prepared` identifies a sealed candidate, not an accepted activation.
- `activation` identifies retained recovery: operation ID, phase, previous and
  candidate SHA, optional `failure`, and the exact `recoveryCommand` using the
  recorded external Node and retained helper. Known failure reason codes are
  shown; other stored error text is replaced with `details-withheld`.
- `lastActivation` is historical verification: operation ID, `outcome`,
  `selectedSha`, and `verifiedAtMs`. Text status labels `succeeded` as **accepted**
  and `rolled-back` as **restored**; restored availability is not candidate success.
  Its optional `gateway` contains the verified `version`, `buildId`, `pid`, and
  `bootId`. Older receipts without these fields remain readable.

These facts come from the installation record, so a fresh CLI observer can read
them after the updater exits. They do not probe the current process or grant
activation authority. A retained `activation` remains pending recovery even when
`lastActivation` records restored availability or an older accepted update.

Immutable preparation does not switch stored channels and rejects package targets such as `--tag`. `--sha` is available only
for adopted immutable installations. Gateway `update.run` still requires the
root installation owner to run the CLI outside the Gateway service cgroup; it
does not elevate chat requests. `update repair` directs immutable recovery to
`update recover`.

Immutable status and dry-run also explain migration coverage. JSON exposes
`immutableCoverage` in status and `coverage` in dry-run. The report inventories
default, configured external, and registered agent stores, including absent paths
and the registry's original path aliases. It reports declared plugin migration
resources and warnings for undeclared resources. External paths are identified;
their presence does not establish candidate migration support.

For an already-prepared target, inspection compares the current package, candidate
package, and preparation receipt schema contracts and shows each store's schema
version against that target. A crossing such as agent schema 24 → 25 names the
reason immutable activation refuses it before drain. An unprepared SHA has
**unknown** target coverage: inspection does not fetch, build, or boot it. Matching
schema versions are not physical-schema, backup, migration, or activation readiness
proof; plugin migration coverage remains unknown.

Live inventory uses the adopted service's effective environment and configuration.
If those cannot be read, the report retains the available preparation facts and
explains the inventory gap. Run inspection as the installation owner for complete
service visibility. Database inspection preserves live SQLite artifacts using
private scratch copies, which are disposed afterward; large stores can make this
read-only inspection expensive. It does not migrate data, write configuration,
enable activation, or stop the serving Gateway.

The serving Gateway must support committed suspension handoff. A new CLI cannot
add that capability to an older running process. For the first native activation,
have the existing installation owner prepare and activate one bridge release
containing this feature. Keep its adoption preparation-only during that bridge.
After the bridge is healthy and the previous updater has settled and stopped
scheduling, enable native activation from the serving release:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/node /opt/example/current/dist/index.js update adopt-immutable \
  --root /opt/example \
  --service example.service \
  --account openclaw \
  --state-dir /var/lib/example \
  --config /etc/example/openclaw.json \
  --runtime /usr/bin/node \
  --previous-updater-stopped \
  --enable-activation
```

Run adoption as root only after the previous updater has settled and stopped
scheduling. The acknowledgement does not stop another updater for you. Adoption
verifies the existing systemd unit, fixed nonroot service account, explicit
effective state/configuration paths and optional `--profile`, external Node
executable, and sealed current generation before recording ownership. Existing
systemd environment files are read through the native service reader. Services
with a different filesystem root, dynamic accounts, or command-line profile
overrides are not supported. Native activation requires cgroup v2 so the updater
can verify that the old service and its descendants have stopped. Adoption never
edits or restarts the service. Omit
`--enable-activation` to adopt for preparation only. To enable an earlier
preparation-only adoption, rerun the original adoption command with the flag;
the installation and service identities must still match.
For a preparation-only adoption whose existing owner activated the bridge,
explicit enablement reconciles the selected generation after verifying both
sealed generations and the live bridge process. It retains the predecessor and
preserves all other installation bindings. The exact packaged v1 launcher is
backed up and upgraded atomically; a custom or modified launcher is preserved and
refused. An already-enabled record never accepts an external pointer change.

Prepare and activate the next reviewed generation as root, outside the service
cgroup. It must differ from the bridge release to exercise a native cutover:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/node /opt/example/current/dist/index.js update --sha <candidate-sha> --no-restart
sudo /usr/bin/node /opt/example/current/dist/index.js update --sha <candidate-sha> --drain-timeout 30
sudo /usr/bin/node /opt/example/current/dist/index.js update recover --root /opt/example
```

Before drain, activation prepares one independently sealed copy of its invoking
runtime per source SHA under the installation-sibling control directory's
`recovery-<sha>` path. Its `recovery.mjs` launcher uses the adopted external Node
and the same native recovery owner. It remains executable without the candidate
or a private deployment checkout. There is no runtime copy or build during
cutover.

`update recover --root <installation-root>` reconciles retained pointer and
service effects before continuing. It verifies a healthy selected candidate or
restored predecessor and retires the record without another restart. Run it
from either retained immutable-capable generation if `current` needs recovery.
Pending and rolled-back results also print an exact `Recovery:` command and
include `recoveryCommand` in JSON. Use that independent helper when a release
directory is unavailable; preserve its control directory and sealed runtime.
`--timeout <seconds>` bounds readiness observation; `--json` returns the result
and receipt lines without mixing prose into stdout. Recovery also accepts
`--drain-timeout`; it applies only if an unhealthy service must be stopped.
Healthy recovery never drains or restarts the serving process. Preserve the record and
retained releases while recovery is pending.
If recovery retries a stopped candidate and confirms another startup failure,
it uses the same protected predecessor rollback as activation. A candidate still
starting or an inconclusive check remains pending.
If the updater is interrupted after shutdown commits, the Gateway still completes
its shutdown. Keep the independent recovery command available: recovery observes
whether the supervisor restarted the predecessor or the service is stopped
before taking another action. A lost handoff reply never authorizes a blind
native stop or a fallback to the older reversible handoff.

After an updater crash, recovery can repair a hot SQLite rollback journal in
the installation control or its native executor lease. It first validates a
private recovered copy and acquires current ownership before allowing SQLite to
repair the source. Ordinary update and status reads do not perform that repair.
Repairing preparation-only metadata never enables activation.

The [immutable update design](/reference/team-immutable-update-design#three-proposed-prs)
records the preparation, activation, and recovery contracts. Existing
published updaters need explicit adoption after installing an immutable-capable
release; candidate code cannot change the behavior of an older installed updater.

## Candidate-owned admission

For package-manager updates, `openclaw update` privately stages the selected
package once, then lets that candidate decide whether the live installation can
be updated. Registry targets and explicit artifacts such as `--tag ./openclaw.tgz`
use the same flow. The stage is reused for verification, canary rehearsal, and
activation; a refusal or pre-mutation failure removes it and leaves the installed
package and serving Gateway in place. After admission and package verification,
a matching installed version and artifact build identity remain a no-op unless
the update needs to replace the installation method or a separate serving root.
The temporary candidate is removed without activating it.

When replacement is needed, the updater retains its running worker files before
changing the installed package. Linux OverlayFS installations use private copies
so hard-link copy-up cannot invalidate the retained files’ identity checks.
Other supported filesystems keep the hard-link fast path and copy fallback.

SQLite read-only workers use that retained generation through post-install
verification, even after the package manager removes the previous package path.
The updater joins those workers before returning. It records completed runtime
projections for cleanup by the next eligible update or `openclaw doctor --fix`,
so recursive deletion does not delay command exit after the final result.
Cleanup keeps projections while another OpenClaw process may still use them.
Already-installed older updaters, including 2026.9.6, still run their original
worker-launch code; installing a corrected candidate cannot repair that first hop.

Source updates retain a retired workspace dependency link when only its ignored `node_modules` directory remains.
An older installed updater that fails at `updater-runtime-retention` needs this correction in its running code before retrying; a newer candidate cannot repair that earlier step.

Runtime retention excludes updater-owned package backups in the global module
directory, including backup symlinks to source checkouts. An older installed
updater such as `2026.9.6` can still follow a retained
`.openclaw.package-backup-*` link and refuse an update with a host-owned plugin-link
error. Preserve that historical link outside the global module directory, keeping
its resolved target unchanged, before retrying. Do not delete its source checkout
or move backups belonging to an active or unresolved update.

The installed updater reads the candidate's `package.json` before running its
pending lifecycle scripts. `openclaw.updateAdmissionProtocol: 1` advertises the
internal admission command. Reading this marker does not execute candidate code.
Managed-service preflight still runs in the installed updater before the
candidate admission process starts.

| Owner                                | Checks and operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Candidate-owned (via `update admit`) | Config read/validation with the candidate schema (missing-path style problems that candidate Doctor preserves/handles are `admit` + warning), database schema preflight against the explicit installation root, plugin availability preflight. The Node engine comparison is informational (`ok` or `warn`) and cannot refuse admission. |
| Installed-owned (unchanged)          | Run admission/ledger, executor lease, managed-service preflight (ownership/ancestry), Node runtime selection/provisioning, directory permissions, npm/pnpm lifecycle policy, staging/verify/canary/swap/post-core.                                                                                                                       |

The candidate inspects the live installation read-only, using the same selected
profile, state directory, configuration path, and environment. It does not
acquire a lease, write history, run Doctor repairs, start a Gateway, or receive
update execution authority. A missing custom `plugins.load.paths` entry can
therefore produce an admission warning while preserving the configured path
and plugin configuration bytes. Admission does not promise to repair that path.

Legacy plugin configuration, such as Discord's nested `dm.policy` and
`dm.allowFrom`, is admitted with a warning when the candidate's Doctor planner
produces a fully valid configuration. Admission checks the projected database
targets while preserving the original config and state bytes. The normal
update-time Doctor still owns saving the repair, backups, and rollback.

A valid `admit` verdict replaces only the candidate-owned checks it reports.
Installed Node preflight always runs for package updates, including selection or
private provisioning of a compatible runtime after an informational Node warning.
A valid `refuse` verdict reports the candidate's reason and next action through
the usual pre-mutation error and JSON output. History records the checks in a
`candidate-admission` step. The installed updater continues to own the update
after admission, including every mutation.

If the marker is absent or invalid, the updater uses its installed admission
checks and records `update-admission-unsupported-target`. If the candidate times
out, crashes, or returns no valid protocol-1 verdict, it records
`update-admission-fallback` and uses those same installed checks. These warnings
are informational; the installed checks determine whether the update proceeds.
Both warning steps retain their identity, status, and timestamps when history
compacts at its 128-step or 16 KiB limit. Warning text can be compacted to fit
that limit. This requires no migration and does not change admission decisions.

Use `--admission installed` to force the installed checks. The default option is
`--admission auto`; this option has no environment-variable form. `--dry-run` always
uses installed checks and does not stage a package or invoke candidate admission.
Git/source updates keep their existing flow.

`openclaw update admit` is an internal command, hidden from help. The supervisor
passes `--context <absolute-path>` to a private mode-0600 context file; this command
path and required argument select admission child mode. The command emits
one JSON document with `protocol`, `verdict`, `reasons`, `warnings`, and `facts`
containing candidate/installed versions, the candidate's `nodeEngines` requirement
when declared, and named check results. It exits `0`
for admission, `3` for refusal, or `2` for an internal error without a valid
verdict. It rejects inherited update authority variables with exit `2`, allowing
the supervisor to fall back. It does not perform managed-service ancestry checks.
The default admission budget is 120 seconds and follows the canary timeout
budget resolution.

Run JSON includes `run.admission` with `owner: "candidate"` or `"installed"`,
and optional `protocol`, `candidateVersion`, `checks`, and `fallbackReason`.
The ledger stores this metadata in its existing origin JSON;
`run.origin.candidateAdmission` retains the bounded, redacted verdict, including
all recorded reasons and warnings. Older history records can omit admission
metadata.

Admission metadata is diagnostic and can be omitted from history when recovery
receipts use the full history budget.

This handoff works only when the installed updater already supports it. An older
updater that refuses before staging cannot use a newer candidate's judgment;
follow the recovery guidance for that installed release first.

## Automation and SSH

For an authorized update on another host, use the target installation's owning
account and a non-interactive SSH command:

```bash
ssh -T user@gateway-host 'openclaw update --yes' </dev/null
```

Ensure `openclaw` resolves to the intended installation in that account's SSH
environment. Add the existing global `--profile <name>` before `update` when
targeting a named profile.

An active chat session alone does not prevent an explicit update. `--yes` skips
confirmation and optional shell-completion prompts. Without it, ordinary upgrades
can still run with piped input, but an operation requiring confirmation, such as a
downgrade, fails promptly. Failure-report menus and triage consent prompts do not
wait for input when stdin is not a terminal. `--yes` does not grant exec approval
or accept changed plugin capabilities.

An agent updating the Gateway that hosts its own session should use the
`gateway` tool's `update.run` action when available. The SSH recipe is for another
host; verify that the destination is not that same Gateway. Normal execution
approvals and deployment ownership still apply.

## Native service commands during updates

Native service install, restart, and stop commands launched by the updater through
the target CLI retain the original update owner while their child processes settle. A command whose owner exits or
loses its lease cannot start another native mutation or commit its pending config
changes. A new update remains excluded while a registered child or its process
group is still alive.

The target runtime must support this ownership handoff. Candidate validation checks
that support before stopping the Gateway or activating its replacement. A missing
target CLI or an older target without support is refused; the updater does not
invoke the old runtime installer as a substitute. Authorized installation-root
changes bind the destination CLI separately while retaining the original update owner. Update-owned commands also refuse unmanaged
restart/stop and detached restart or Windows Startup-folder fallbacks that cannot
retain this ownership. Ordinary user-invoked `openclaw gateway` commands keep their
existing behavior.

On Windows, capability checks stay alive until the updater finishes binding their
process identity. If Windows cannot supply a process creation timestamp, the
updater retains the identity established by the live parent or uses the child's
recorded launcher identity, with a warning in the run history and diagnostic logs.
A different observed identity still refuses the
handoff. Scheduled Tasks using `InteractiveToken` remain supported; this does not
require storing a task password.

This target-CLI protection does not cover every Doctor or plugin child or the
in-process service preparation before package mutation.

After Scheduled Task autostart has been suspended, cancelling before installation
mutation restores it before exit, while retaining checks on the original update
owner and task identity. This protection belongs to the installed updater;
installing a release with the fix enables it for the next update that release
performs.

## Options

Post-core repair Doctor and `openclaw update finalize` run without a separate
per-Doctor deadline unless the operator supplies `--timeout`. A fresh post-core
process receives the operator choice separately from its internal step allowance.
Older targets retain their existing allowance and deadline behavior.

When `--timeout` is omitted, current CLI and RPC finalization do not add an aggregate
activation deadline. Explicit operator limits and inherited activation allowances
still apply; older or unrecognized handoffs retain their existing finite-deadline
behavior. Checks, ownership admission, readiness, recovery, and cleanup retain
their own bounds. An explicit `--timeout <seconds>` limits each finalization phase
and its child commands. Admission and config phases scale with shared SQLite state.

After activation or rollback is verified, obsolete package and launcher backup
trees share a five-minute cleanup budget. Expiry retains the remaining backups
and records their paths as a warning without undoing the verified installation.
Cleanup checks this budget between filesystem operations and waits for operations
already in flight to settle, so stalled storage can extend the cleanup wait.
Ownership and path-identity failures remain distinct from cleanup expiry.

A later verified package activation also retires historical package backups
captured before that update began. Symlink retirement removes only the link;
source checkouts remain untouched. Failed updates and rollbacks preserve those
historical backups, and separately retained database snapshots keep their own
recovery lifetime.

Post-plugin config validation and readiness checks use the measured shared and
agent database sizes after Doctor finishes, including WAL files. Post-core plugin
installation and update work have no default deadline when `--timeout` is omitted;
explicit operator limits and older caller allowances still apply. When an aggregate
activation budget is present, it uses the measured database sizes, observed candidate startup, plugin
count, and the caller's step allowance. Migrated finalization preserves explicit or
inherited allowances. Aggregate expiry reports `update-activation-timeout` and
retains ownership until writers settle; it does not authorize rollback or restart.
Use `openclaw update status` and Doctor for recovery guidance.

There is no `--verbose` flag. Use `--dry-run` to preview planned actions,
`--json` for machine-readable results, and `openclaw update status --json`
for channel, availability, and the latest durable update report. Gateway console verbosity (`--verbose`) and
file log level (`logging.level: "debug"`/`"trace"`) are independent knobs; see
[Gateway logging](/gateway/logging).

With `--no-restart`, state verification blocked by another process is deferred,
and the installed update is recorded with Gateway readiness unverified. That
recorded contention also defers Gateway recovery verification. Restart the Gateway through its service
owner, then run `openclaw update status` and `openclaw doctor`; keep recovery backups
until verification completes. Other failures keep their recovery diagnostics;
a genuine database incompatibility still fails.

Interactive updates show phase transitions, the current step, and elapsed time.
The phases match the Control UI: requested, staging, validating, activating,
restarting, verifying, and finished. When output is piped or captured in a log,
progress prints without animation and reports elapsed time every 30 seconds while
a step is running. Updates, verification, and rollback do not
require inference or model authentication. Model-auth findings remain warnings.
Automatic inference repair belongs to triage after an update has finished with
a failed outcome and released its update ownership; it does not change that
recorded outcome. Reports from older updaters can still contain a `repairing` phase.
Failed steps include the final diagnostics from both output streams; timeouts
are labeled explicitly. The final report includes the outcome, recorded phase durations, failed steps,
verification facts, and recovery guidance. `--json` keeps stdout machine-readable and does not
print progress steps or run the progress observer. Progress observes committed
ledger rows through a reusable read-only worker connection instead of repeatedly
copying shared state. This applies to updates launched by the fixed updater; a
published older updater keeps its own progress reader until it is replaced.

When no update is active, `openclaw update status` labels the saved outcome
`Last recorded update` with the recorded start time, so historical results are
distinct from current update activity.

When switching from a dev checkout to a package, the updater replaces npm's
install link and leaves the external checkout untouched. If activation fails,
restoring that link and its launchers does not verify the mutable checkout's
runtime. Recovery stays unverified and does not authorize an automatic restart;
inspect the checkout and recovery report before restarting it.

For a profile without a runtime database, an older npm target initializes its
compatible state before the updater records history. The selected release's
Doctor runs before activation, including when npm's install hooks already created
the database. Existing databases retain their downgrade protections. When the
updater can read shared state, target-release preflight also checks configured,
retired, and registered custom agent stores and names every incompatible store
before changing the installation or stopping the Gateway. State newer than the
updater can read retains a single install-compatible-build or restore-backup refusal.

If database schema preflight cannot inspect the configured paths because the
config is invalid, its refusal lists the config file and invalid fields. Run
`openclaw doctor --fix` to repair retired or unrecognized fields, correct any
remaining errors, and retry the update. Preflight leaves the config unchanged.

Explicit package specs on a fresh profile first stage with a temporary OpenClaw
profile. The updater inspects the staged runtime's declared schema and Node
requirements before admitting changes to the selected profile. Artifacts without
declared schema support are refused without creating the profile's runtime database.
Preparation uses the original package spec and owning package manager.

A fresh-profile `--dry-run` leaves the database absent and does not record a run.
For package targets, it checks the exact target's Node requirements using the same
runtime planner as a real update. Text output and JSON `notes` report `Would refuse
update` when no usable runtime is available, or `Would replace` when the updater can
refresh its owned managed service to a compatible Node. The preview still exits
successfully and does not install a package or change the service.
If package metadata cannot be resolved, retry with an exact published `--tag`;
failed target selection does not initialize the profile with the updater's schema.
Metadata failures retain the detected update mode and a specific failure fact for
registry lookup, dist-tag resolution, version mismatch, schema declarations, or
Git target inspection. The summary and `openclaw update status --json` include
the reason and next step; the bounded failure report includes the same public
description without publishing local paths or registry response text. Existing
updaters cannot gain these diagnostics until the candidate has been installed.

`--dry-run --json` reports the known installed version in `currentVersion` for
package and Git installs, including a saved dev channel that selects conversion
to Git. If the target version is unresolved, `targetVersion` remains `null` and
the additive `targetVersionReason` field explains why. Resolved targets omit this
field. The text preview also shows the installed version and explains unresolved
targets.

`--yes` also skips the optional shell-completion setup prompt. Existing
completion profiles and caches are still repaired when needed; installing
completion in a new shell profile remains an interactive choice.

`--tag` changes only this package update. A saved `update.channel` continues to
govern later foreground and automatic updates, even after a one-off beta
install. Use `--channel` to change that policy.

For explicit package artifacts, configured plugin availability is checked against the privately staged package version before rehearsal or activation. `--dry-run` does not stage the artifact and reports that this check remains pending.

Managed update handoffs preserve the selected artifact, including already-current
repeats, so target checks use that artifact's database schema and runtime requirements.

For source checkouts, `--dry-run` previews the update flow without fetching Git
refs or checking working-tree changes. The real update checks for uncommitted
changes before modifying the checkout. Use `openclaw update status` to inspect
the current branch, version, and update availability.

<Note>
In Nix mode (`OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1`), mutating `openclaw update` runs are disabled. Update the Nix source or flake input for this install instead; for nix-openclaw, use the agent-first [Quick Start](https://github.com/openclaw/nix-openclaw#quick-start). `openclaw update status` remains read-only. `openclaw update --dry-run` previews the flow without changing the installation. It records a skipped run only when the profile already has a runtime database.
</Note>

<Warning>
Downgrades require confirmation because older versions can break configuration.
If the install has already migrated sessions to SQLite, restore archived legacy
transcript artifacts before starting an older file-backed version. See
[Doctor: Downgrading after session SQLite migration](/cli/doctor#downgrading-after-session-sqlite-migration).
</Warning>

## `update wizard`

Interactive flow to pick an update channel and confirm whether to restart the
Gateway afterward (defaults to restart). Selecting `dev` without a git
checkout offers to create one.

The channel picker reads the local install identity without checking Git
freshness or dependencies. Those checks run when you apply the update; use
`openclaw update status` to inspect availability first.

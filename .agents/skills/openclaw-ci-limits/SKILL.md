# OpenClaw CI Limits

Use this skill for CI capacity changes, not ordinary test failure triage. The
goal is to keep OpenClaw fast while distinguishing runner registration, runner
availability, Blacksmith control-plane health, and downstream queue drains.

## Core Facts

- Do not assume the scarce resource. Prove whether pressure is runner
  registrations, eligible runner availability, Blacksmith capacity/control
  plane, workflow dependencies, test runtime, or a downstream queue writer.
- GitHub runner registrations for `openclaw` currently report a 10,000 per
  5-minute bucket in `actions_runner_registration`. Verify the live bucket
  before each tuning pass because GitHub can change it. The `openclaw`
  organization shares one bucket.
- Core REST quota does not draw down this bucket. Check
  `actions_runner_registration` separately; core quota can be healthy while
  runner registration is throttled.
- Use about 60% of the live bucket as the operating target. With the current
  10,000-registration bucket, keep planned Blacksmith burst load under 6,000
  registrations per 5 minutes and leave the rest for other repos, retries, and
  burst overlap.
- Jobs that route, notify, summarize, choose shards, or run short CodeQL quality
  scans should stay on GitHub-hosted runners unless measured evidence says
  Blacksmith is required.

## Rejected Experiments

- **Hosted Mac exact dependencies (2026-09-01):** The same-head publisher and
  consumer in [run 33458856298](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33458856298)
  successfully saved and restored a 1.66-GB dependency archive, but setup took
  142s versus 86s with the ordinary store cache. Extraction took 82s versus 27s;
  install improved only from 43s to 35s. Keep hosted Mac jobs on the ordinary
  store cache. Reconsider only with measured total setup savings, including
  transfer, extraction and frozen reconciliation, not a successful cache hit.
- **Actions-artifact checkout (2026-08-16):** Do not recommend replacing the
  shared Blacksmith Git fetch with a preflight-produced workspace or `.git`
  artifact. [PR #124818](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/124818)
  measured a 16s Blacksmith checkout baseline versus 7s hosted. The best direct
  artifact variant cost 1s to pack, 3s to upload, and 11s median to restore;
  including the serial prefix left only about 1s median improvement and
  regressed Blacksmith's fast-fetch runs. The official artifact client was
  worse: [run 31971531521](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/31971531521)
  measured 22s median download plus 2s materialization. Blacksmith's fast
  Actions-cache path does not imply fast Actions-artifact downloads. Reconsider
  only with measured end-to-end proof for a different transport, including its
  producer cost and fast-fetch regressions.

## First Checks

Before changing CI, collect current pressure:

```bash
gh api rate_limit --jq '{core:.resources.core,graphql:.resources.graphql,search:.resources.search,actions_runner_registration:.resources.actions_runner_registration}'
gh run list -R openclaw/openclaw --limit 20 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,workflowName,event,headBranch,createdAt,updatedAt,url
gh run list -R openclaw/clawsweeper --limit 20 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,workflowName,event,headBranch,createdAt,updatedAt,url
gh api repos/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/<run-id>/jobs --paginate --jq '.jobs[] | {id,name,status,conclusion,labels,created_at,started_at,completed_at,runner_name,runner_group_name}'
blacksmith testbox list --all
curl -fsS https://clawsweeper.openclaw.ai/api/status | jq '{generated_at,fleet,diagnostics:{errors:.diagnostics.errors}}'
curl -fsS https://clawsweeper.openclaw.ai/api/exact-review-queue | jq '{generated_at,review:.lanes.review,publication:.lanes.publication,state_writer,state_append}'
node scripts/ci-run-timings.mjs --latest-main
node scripts/ci-run-timings.mjs --recent 10
```

For a suspicious queued run, inspect its jobs. A run-level `queued` status does
not reveal whether the job is waiting on dependencies or has no eligible
runner. Compare `created_at`, `started_at`, `labels`, and `runner_name`. Recheck
stale queued runs live before canceling them; cancel only runs proven obsolete.

`scripts/ci-run-timings.mjs` start delay can include workflow dependency wait
plus runner queue time. It is trend evidence, not runner-pressure proof alone.

Read:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/codeql-critical-quality.yml`
- `docs/ci.md`
- `test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts`
- touched planner files under `scripts/lib/*ci*`, `scripts/lib/*test-plan*`, or
  `scripts/ci-changed-scope.mjs`

## Diagnose The Bottleneck

Classify the issue before changing caps:

- **Runner-registration throttle:** many jobs queued before runner assignment,
  Blacksmith/GitHub reports 403/429 or spam-style 422 responses from
  `generate-jitconfig`, and API core quota is still healthy. Treat 422 as this
  signal only when the request payload is otherwise valid. Fix burstiness and
  Blacksmith job count.
- **Blacksmith capacity:** Blacksmith dashboard shows actual concurrency caps or
  unavailable capacity. Do not solve this with GitHub workflow fanout alone.
- **Blacksmith Testbox control plane:** list, warm, status, or run calls time out
  before a lease is returned. This is separate from Actions runner registration
  and Actions job capacity. Trusted source may use the documented local
  fallback; untrusted source stays blocked.
- **Unavailable runner label:** a job is queued with a custom `runs-on` label,
  `started_at` and `runner_name` remain empty, and no eligible runner exists.
  Restore an available hosted or registered label; fanout cannot fix it.
- **Workflow dependency wait:** the job is queued but required predecessors are
  not terminal. Fix or wait for the dependency; do not call the whole delay
  runner queue pressure.
- **OpenClaw test runtime:** jobs start quickly but one lane dominates wall time.
  Use `$openclaw-test-performance` instead of runner tuning.
- **Real failing CI:** one job fails after starting. Use `$github:gh-fix-ci` or
  `$openclaw-testing`, not this skill.
- **ClawSweeper review backlog:** review pending/ready grows while publication
  and state writers remain healthy. Tune review admission/workers in
  `openclaw/clawsweeper`.
- **ClawSweeper publication backlog:** publication pending/ready and oldest age
  grow, net drain is zero or negative, or dead letters rise. Inspect publication
  batches, state-writer coordination, and GitHub mutation latency first.
- **State materializer/append backlog:** `state_append.pending_rows`,
  `pending_bytes`, or oldest age grows while the materializer is queued or
  absent. Recover that sole drain first; more review workers make it worse.

## Registration Budget Math

Estimate worst-case registrations for a change before editing:

```text
new Blacksmith registrations ~= number of Blacksmith jobs that can become queued
inside one 5 minute window
```

For matrix jobs, count every row that can start in the 5-minute window.
`strategy.max-parallel` only caps simultaneous rows; short rows can turn over
and register more runners before the window resets. Use job duration, retries,
and queue turnover to justify any lower estimate. Add non-matrix Blacksmith jobs
such as `preflight`, `security-fast`, `build-artifacts`, and platform lanes.

For repeated pull-request pushes, multiply by the number of runs expected to
reach Blacksmith admission in the same 5-minute window, including runs canceled
after admission. Canonical `main` uses two run-number-parity slots. Each slot
keeps one active non-canceling run and one coalesced pending tip. Budget for up
to two active main matrices plus their two pending tips entering the next
admission wave, not every intermediate merge.

Reject a change unless the org-level worst case stays below about 60% of the
live bucket. With the current 10,000-registration bucket, keep planned
Blacksmith burst load under 6,000 registrations per 5 minutes with headroom for
ClawSweeper, ClawHub, Clownfish, OpenClaw RTT, and Clawbench.

## Safe Levers

Prefer these in order:

1. Preserve cancel-in-progress for superseded pull-request heads.
2. Preserve canonical `main` as two non-canceling parity slots; each slot's
   default pending run coalesces to the newest tip.
3. Move high-frequency, short, non-build jobs to `ubuntu-24.04`.
4. Reduce matrix rows by bundling related tests inside one runner job when the
   combined job stays under timeout and keeps useful failure names.
5. Lower `strategy.max-parallel` for bursty Blacksmith matrices.
6. Right-size runners from timing evidence. Use fewer/larger jobs only when
   elapsed time improves enough to justify registration count.
7. Split truly slow tests with `$openclaw-test-performance`; do not hide a slow
   test problem by registering more runners.

Do not:

- add another Blacksmith installation expecting a higher registration bucket;
- move CodeQL Critical Quality back to Blacksmith;
- raise all `max-parallel` values at once;
- make manual `workflow_dispatch` runs cancel normal push/PR validation;
- delete coverage just to reduce runner count;
- treat cancelled superseded pull-request runs as failures without checking the
  newest run for the same ref.
- cancel old queued runs from a stale snapshot; re-query the exact run first and
  preserve any current run that still owns live work.

## Current OpenClaw Knobs

These are intentionally guarded by `test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts`:

- `CI` concurrency key version, PR cancellation, and canonical `main`'s two
  non-canceling parity slots, each with one coalesced pending tip.
- `preflight` and `security-fast` start immediately without a debounce
  or standalone admission job. The protected `vitest-cache-warm` workflow
  publishes the immutable semantic dependency archive after setup succeeds,
  before build and transform warming. Preflight and downstream Node jobs are
  restore-only consumers on eligible self-hosted runners. Exact misses and
  hosted paths, including Mac Node jobs, use the ordinary pnpm-store cache.
- `ci-gate` always uses `ubuntu-24.04` for its Bash-only result aggregation,
  without checkout or dependency setup. This removes one Blacksmith registration
  from previously eligible runs; hosted assignment can still delay completion.
  `preflight` uses GitHub-hosted Ubuntu in hybrid mode; its logical planner
  profile and cache trust stay unchanged. Default Blacksmith preflight routing
  remains intact. `security-fast` stays hosted outside eligible hybrid first
  attempts. Security hooks use pinned installed packages
  and local hook definitions, without remote Git initialization. The `github`
  outage override remains intact. Budget one control-job registration per eligible
  Blacksmith run or eligible hybrid first attempt.
  The aggregate uses `!cancelled()` to report failed prerequisites without
  holding a superseded run open after workflow cancellation.
- Current fast plugin/channel contract families each share one checkout/setup.
  Their two weighted process envelopes run sequentially with unchanged include
  lists and package commands; channel invocations retain four project slots and
  one worker per project. Any nonzero exit stops admission of the next envelope.
  Frozen targets retain their original separate rows.
- CI matrix caps: fast/check lanes at 12, Node test shards at 96, Windows at 2,
  and Android at 2. Every compact profile has an enforced 80-row budget, plugin
  fallback has a 50-row budget, and the final Node matrix enforces 64 push or
  120 PR rows, including precise plans. Excess inventory fails preflight.
- Windows keeps two disjoint file inventories and at most two concurrent jobs.
  Each job runs project processes serially with one Vitest worker on every
  backend, after runtime preparation completes. Native allocation can be smaller
  than the runner label. Native proof must cover available CPUs/RAM, fixture
  memory and cleanup. This adds no runner registrations.
- macOS Swift regular PR/main and PR `release_gate` CI retains the complete
  shared/app test workload plus lint/schema guards in one `tests` phase.
  Ordinary full-scope manual validation adds independent release compilation,
  moves the guards to `release`, and retains health renders in `tests`.
  Both phases use GitHub-hosted `macos-26`, `max-parallel: 2`, and the existing
  30-minute budget. Build caches stay phase-owned; the sole eligible shared
  SwiftPM cache writer is regular `tests` or full-validation `release`.
- Android regular CI uses four test/lint rows, including benchmark compilation
  in the Kotlin-lint row when benchmark/build/dependency inputs change or the
  changed-path manifest is unusable. Full manual validation retains all six
  rows and memory-bounded phone/Wear/benchmark builds without duplicate lint.
  The cap stays at two; frozen task contracts and npm native deferral are unchanged.
- iOS regular PR/main and PR `release_gate` CI runs one required Debug build
  and Swift lint smoke. Ordinary full-scope manual validation retains Release
  and Debug/native-test phases, both screenshot shards, and the evidence reducer.
  Frozen full-manual targets keep their Debug-only contract without screenshots;
  npm qualification still defers native jobs. All iOS build phases and screenshot
  shards use `macos-26` from the first attempt.
  The conservative full-tier non-Node inventory, including Control UI performance, is
  86 rows, or 87 for historical UI targets. Excluding those four hosted rows
  plus both macOS Swift phases and the always-hosted aggregate gate leaves at
  most 80 potentially eligible jobs. The enforced Node caps therefore give
  144 registrations per main run and 200 per PR:
  `4 × 144 + 21 × 200 = 4,776` in the retained peak arrival envelope.
  The old 19-arrival estimate is obsolete. The remaining 1,224 below
  the 6,000 reference target must cover adjacent repositories, releases and
  carryover; the bounded 2026-09-02 census did not prove that upper bound.
  Treat a single PR concurrency trial separately from a global rollout.
  A shared-token quota response does not establish organization-wide usage.
  Budget all six npm qualification jobs and the actual full-release children;
  ordinary manual check rows can still use Blacksmith outside hybrid mode.
- Canonical PR Node tests use one precise changed-target job when possible;
  broad, deleted or unknown changes fall back to the compact full-suite plan
  plus affected plugin coverage. Current PR planner errors fail preflight.
  Targeted plans retain the full built-artifact
  boundary gate. `main` uses compact integration; manual and release runs use
  full named shards.
- The combined Node matrix admits compact and plugin descriptors by estimated
  duration within the same cap. Catch-all, QA and provider configs use the
  existing 90-file envelope budget with native Vitest sharding; retain complete
  config discovery, exclusions and process isolation. Count every appended
  plugin row, including the five added QA/provider rows, in the burst envelope.
- Precise and fallback plugin groups retain separate child processes, including process-bounded
  configs. Compatible envelopes, including repeated configs, run one at a time
  within 240 predicted seconds without a pair-count limit; expanded serial compact
  jobs use 210. Runtime preparation stays separate. Each original envelope retains
  its file/process bounds, native shard arguments and worker limits. The complete supplemental boundary list runs in one job
  with four concurrent checks and one full-root focused-rule scan.
- Measured Blacksmith chat/session, Gateway core-3 and infrastructure storage/state
  outliers reuse the existing file splitter. Preserve serial execution, worker
  pins and complete timing-history floors; no blanket increase in sharding.
- Blacksmith and hybrid compact bins with multiple ordinary groups request the
  existing 32-vCPU class and two child slots with a 360s aggregate budget.
  Compatible two-slot bins use the time budget without the ten-group cutoff;
  serial bins retain that cutoff. Blacksmith serial bins retain 200/276s, hybrid serial bins retain 210s,
  exclusive bins retain 150s by default, and groups above their serial cap stay alone.
  Complete ordinary hybrid bins containing only non-build CLI groups may use
  250s and co-locate split siblings, provided each original child still fits
  150s. Keep file splits, workers, process isolation and other profiles unchanged.
  Initial packing separates runtime consumers from ordinary groups. Complete
  hybrid main and PR runtime-placement observations apply only after file splitting;
  precise changed-file templates retain their original capacity and floors.
  Typed observations preserve configs, environment, complete files and build mode.
  Prefer an exact measurement; otherwise use the maximum compatible contained
  workload as an advisory floor, never sum overlaps or treat globs as whole files.
  Whole pinned runtime groups may move to existing compatible ordinary jobs under
  a 440s budget including the existing 100s build reserve. Keep runner anchors,
  test partitions, invocation counts and worker limits. An ordinary recipient
  becomes serial, explicitly retaining its old parallel groups' two-worker budget
  while preserving their prepared timing identities and complete parent
  generations. The CI executor applies the smaller of the
  supplied job ceiling and group cap. This may add one runtime preparation while
  reducing requested process slots; measure the tradeoff without adding jobs or
  registrations. Equal maximum estimates prefer more recipient headroom.
  Reapply shared family, group-count and budget admission to both replacements;
  never suppress coverage or count a runtime subset as a complete parent.
  An unfit optimization retains the runnable plan and its truthful estimate.
  Compare recipients with the donor job's fixed anchor, not only its group class.
  Exclusive, private-QA, dist and hosted policies stay unchanged.
  Affordable generated CLI runtime children may share one preparation in an
  exclusive serial bin within the same 150s budget; fixed stripe families remain
  separate. Other hybrid exclusive/dist sharing is unchanged. Complete inventories
  remain intact.
  The canonical shard executor admits two CI children only with at least eight
  available CPUs and 24 GiB actual memory; otherwise it admits one. Inner project
  parallelism stays one and each overlapping child keeps two Vitest workers.
  The primary GitHub profile remains serial at 210s. Failed-job-only hybrid
  retries retain the original wider matrix on hosted Ubuntu, clamp to one child,
  and keep two workers per child; they can exceed the eight-minute normal-run
  objective without changing existing deadlines. Fewer jobs must retain native
  elapsed-time, actual memory and cleanup proof; requested labels are not capacity.
- The whole Blacksmith agent-support group requests `blacksmith-32vcpu-ubuntu-2404`.
  Its file inventory and resource-derived worker policy remain unchanged.
- Numbered Blacksmith tooling bins request the same 32-vCPU class after packing.
  Keep their logical classes, names, file inventories, serial project/file
  execution and two-worker pins. This adds no jobs and does not promote hosted
  or hybrid tooling. The native two-CPU/8-GB tails require a larger-host timing
  comparison; capacity alone is not a measured speedup.
- The Docker seed job requests `blacksmith-32vcpu-ubuntu-2404`; its weighted
  scheduler and serial declaration compiler policy stay unchanged.
- Eligible Control UI E2E rows request the 32-vCPU class with unchanged live
  backend/event/contributor routing and two/one-worker project limits. Targets
  with the named-project contract use six shards on non-frozen Blacksmith and
  hybrid first attempts; other fresh plans retain twelve. Historical targets without
  that contract retain four total rows on Blacksmith or fourteen on GitHub/hybrid,
  including the browser-extension row. Failed-job-only PR and hybrid push retries
  retain the six-shard width on hosted Ubuntu with the existing 25-minute timeout.
  The browser-extension row stays on 8. Twelve rows finished by 4:38 in run
  33695337496; the reduced width needs native timing proof and does not refresh
  stale timing weights.
- Eligible real-Gateway jobs request the existing 32-class for the private artifact
  build's two canonical SDK cache misses. Overlap requires at least two available
  CPUs and 25.5 GiB of observed remaining memory for unchanged 12-GiB heaps plus
  768 MiB native headroom each. Unknown finite-cgroup usage or insufficient capacity
  keeps compilation serial. Keep browser workers, inventory, build/read ordering,
  routing, deadlines and all caps unchanged. This adds zero jobs or registrations.
  Compiler-only AWS evidence does not prove CI timing; validate the complete job
  through exact-head native CI before claiming an improvement.
- Current-target `build-artifacts` uses the existing 16-class after a complete
  four-CPU/15.42-GiB compute proof, including the unchanged parallel verifier wave.
  The SDK memory owner keeps declarations serial when two heaps do not fit.
  Frozen or unclassified targets retain 32-class; hosted fallbacks, job counts,
  concurrency and deadlines stay unchanged. Measured compute fit does not prove
  queue savings; observe the next exact-head CI cycle.
- Normal canonical hybrid first attempts use the existing four-part QA smoke
  plan, removing two repeated checkouts, setups and private runtime builds.
  Blacksmith profiles retain four parts; GitHub profiles and fresh hybrid
  retry/manual plans retain six. Failed-job-only retries retain their original
  matrix. Keep the complete scenario inventory, separate Matrix run, worker
  limits, stagger, cleanup and deadlines. Measure the four-part jobs natively;
  summed build intervals are not a wall-time saving estimate.
- GitHub/hybrid test types use three jobs: two paired core rows run the original
  stripes 1+2 and 3+4 sequentially; the central row runs stripe 5 before the
  extensions/scripts/root tail. Keep all 16 core graphs, at most two compiler
  children per stripe, and one builder per child. The central fifth stripe
  retains the standalone core resource environment. A failing stripe stops its
  row; other matrix rows keep running. Pure Blacksmith and targets without
  stripe support retain the full central path. Measure the combined jobs
  natively; fewer registrations alone do not prove the eight-minute target.
- CPU-heavy test-type, core test-type stripe, runtime-topology, and npm preflight
  jobs request `blacksmith-32vcpu-ubuntu-2404`. The 2026-09-01 x64 probe
  [run 33538827388](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33538827388)
  measured requested 8/16/32 labels delivering 2/4/8 CPUs respectively. Treat
  larger requests as a measured capacity workaround, never as worker counts.
  Keep existing routing, fanout, and resource-based worker limits; reassess
  sizing after provider allocation changes. See `docs/ci.md` for the full table.
- lower-weight Node/check shards on `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`.
- heavy retained Linux/Android shards on `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2404`.
- CodeQL Critical Quality on `ubuntu-24.04` with no `blacksmith-` labels.
- `OPENCLAW_CI_RUNNER_BACKEND=github` routes every configurable `ci.yml` job
  to its existing GitHub-hosted fallback label. Unset or `blacksmith` preserves
  the normal Blacksmith-first route.
- Vitest/test compile caches are restore-only in CI and use immutable Actions
  caches; the daily/dispatch warmer is their sole writer. Build compile cache
  writes rotate at most once per UTC day. PRs create no runtime-cache archives.

When changing one knob, update `docs/ci.md` and the guard test in the same PR.

## Blacksmith Outage Circuit Breaker

Use the repository variable only after confirming a Blacksmith outage or
unavailable runner capacity. Do not set it merely for a failing test that has
already started.

```bash
gh variable set OPENCLAW_CI_RUNNER_BACKEND --repo openclaw/openclaw --body github
```

In degraded mode, `ci.yml` uses the same hosted labels and non-Blacksmith paths
as manual dispatches and fork pull requests. Blacksmith-only Docker and sticky
steps stay off, dependency setup uses the ordinary Actions pnpm-store cache,
and Android's large build uses separate low-memory Gradle processes. Standard
4-core hosted runners make builds and test lanes slower. Blacksmith runner
registration is no longer part of the budget, while GitHub-hosted concurrency
limits apply.

Flip back after the outage by deleting the variable:

```bash
gh variable delete OPENCLAW_CI_RUNNER_BACKEND --repo openclaw/openclaw
```

Scheduled health detection and automatic flipping are a follow-up, not part of
the current circuit breaker.

## Validation

For workflow-only or docs/skill-only changes in a Codex worktree:

```bash
node scripts/run-vitest.mjs test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts
node --import tsx scripts/check-workflows.mts
node scripts/docs-list.js
./node_modules/.bin/oxfmt --check .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/codeql-critical-quality.yml docs/ci.md test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts .agents/skills/openclaw-ci-limits/SKILL.md .agents/skills/openclaw-ci-limits/agents/openai.yaml
git diff --check
```

If `pnpm docs:list` tries to reconcile dependencies in a linked Codex worktree,
stop and use `node scripts/docs-list.js`.

For a PR before requesting maintainer approval, bind the watcher to the PR's
full 40-character head SHA:

```bash
.agents/skills/autoreview/scripts/autoreview --mode branch --base origin/main
node scripts/watch-pr-ci.mjs <pr> <head-sha> --repo openclaw/openclaw
```

Use hosted exact-head gates for CI workflow tuning. Do not burn local
`pnpm test` on unrelated full-suite proof.

Only after the maintainer explicitly asks you to prepare or land the PR, run the
repo-native mutating wrapper:

```bash
scripts/pr review-init <pr>
scripts/pr review-artifacts-init <pr>
scripts/pr review-validate-artifacts <pr>
OPENCLAW_TESTBOX=1 scripts/pr prepare-run <pr>
```

`prepare-run` can push a prepared commit to the PR branch. Only run
`scripts/pr merge-run <pr>` after the maintainer has explicitly asked you to
land the PR. Both commands mutate GitHub state.

## Post-Land Monitoring

After merge, watch at least one fresh main cycle and the adjacent repos:

```bash
gh run list -R openclaw/openclaw --limit 20 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,workflowName,event,headBranch,createdAt,updatedAt,url
for repo in openclaw/clawsweeper openclaw/clawhub openclaw/clownfish openclaw/openclaw-rtt openclaw/clawbench; do
  gh run list -R "$repo" --limit 12 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,workflowName,event,headBranch,createdAt,updatedAt,url
done
curl -fsS https://clawsweeper.openclaw.ai/api/exact-review-queue | jq '.'
```

Report:

- exact PR/commit landed;
- expected registration reduction or added headroom;
- CI run status and slowest/queued jobs;
- queued job labels, runner assignment, and dependency state for any outlier;
- Blacksmith Actions runner evidence separately from Testbox control-plane
  health;
- ClawSweeper queue pending, dispatching, leased, oldest pending age;
- publication net drain/dead letters, state-writer queued/waiting, and state
  append rows/bytes/oldest item;
- any real failures that remain outside runner registration.
